<p>Some #code4lib regulars (who also help put on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110610010758/http://access2005.library.ualberta.ca:80/">Access</a> up north) have managed to get some space at the <a href="http://www.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> in February for <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/2006">code4lib 2006</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
code4lib 2006 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-ish format. It is *the* event for technologists building digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A call for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060104184731/http://www.code4lib.org:80/proposals">proposals</a> is out. The nice thing about this conference is that there will be different levels of involvement: from keynote speakers, to shorter presentations, to lightning talks, and with space/time to actually hack at stuff/brainstorm with colleagues.</p>
<p>We're hoping to attract both library professionals who use computers, and computer professionals who have an interest in libraries. The registration is now open as well at a discounted price. If you are interested in computers and libraries please submit a proposal or register to attend!</p>
