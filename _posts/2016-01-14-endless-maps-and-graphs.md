title: Endless Maps and Graphs

From [Morton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton) challenging 
meditation on scale:

> We need to get out of the persuasion business and start getting into the magic
> business, or the catalysis business, or the magnetizing business, or whatever
> you want to call it. Using reason isn't wrong. But with objects this huge,
> this massively distributed, this counterintuitive, this transdimensional, it's
> not enough simply to use art as candy coating on top of facts. We can't just
> be in the PR business. Percy Shelley put it beautifully when he wrote, "We
> [lack] the creative faculty to imagine that which we know." That was back in
> 1820, and it's only gotten worse. Consider the heavy [hydrocarbons] that 
> subtend the soil of the [Lago Agrio oil field] in Ecuador, a black fudge 
> hyperobject that oozes into drinking water, with unknown and under-studied 
> mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. We do not need to keep on parsing the 
> data like [Chevron], the defendants in the lawsuit on behalf of 
> [the people affected by the contaminated soil]. Such parsing of data would 
> be using the very same tactic as the gigantic corporation, the strategy of 
> producing endless maps and graphs. [@Morton:2013, pp 181-182].
