From @Chaffee:2009, p. 126:

> It is often said that the most important tool of structural methods in 
> all fields is the archive – that is, the discovered (or maintained) 
> residue of mental or cultural events held in libraries and other social 
> forms of memory. The structural method is often referred to as 
> archeological or geological in nature – a systematic reconstruction 
> of evidently dead and buried events and objects.

This is the last mention of *the archive* that Chaffee and Lemert make in this
overview of Structuralism and Poststructuralism, so we're kind of left to fill
in the blanks about *who* often said it. But the subsequent discussion of
Derrida and Foucault are good indicators of they might be thinking of.

For someone who studies information it's quite surprising to see how quickly
this little passage moves from talking about libraries to forms of social
memory, to physical processes like geology. It reminds me a bit of Jenkinson's
idea of *naturalness* which @Caravaca:2017 relates to the Italian concept of
*sedimentation* in archives. How do our archival practices shape that
sedimentation process?

As I write this on a computer, in the form of a blog post, by placing a text
file on the file system as Markdown, running a piece of software to convert the
text to HTML, and publishing it to the web using another piece of software, it's
interesting to think about how the structuring method of the archive is present
in the form of computation. Does computation disrupt or distort this
sedimentation process?  Does the debate around the roles of *la parole*
(speaking) and *la langue* (a community's language) in Structuralism and
Poststructuralism have anything useful to say about archival materials and their
deployment on the web?

I guess I'll find out more when I read @Foucault:1966 and @Bourdieu:1977 later
this semester.
