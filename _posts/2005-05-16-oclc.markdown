<p><a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2005/05/_of_records_in_.html">Thom Hickey</a> mentioned a new <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/grow.htm">page</a> at OCLC which lists some real time stats for worldcat: total holdings, last record added, etc. Perhaps this is in honor of the total holdings getting very close to crossing the 1 billion mark. </p>
<p>So of course I had to add a plugin for panizzi to scrape the page. Rather than writing yet another state machine for parsing html I decided to try out Frederik Lundh's <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-tidylib.htm">ElementTree Tidy HTML Tree Builder</a>, which works out very well when you want to walk a datastructure representing possibly invalid HTML. </p>
<pre lang="python">
    url = "http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/grow.htm"
    tree = TidyHTMLTreeBuilder.parse( urlopen( self.url ) )
</pre>
<p>That's all there is to getting nice elementtree object which you can dig into for a page of HTML.</p>
<p>So, predictably:</p>
