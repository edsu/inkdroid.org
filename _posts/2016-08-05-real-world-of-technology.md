I just got finished listening to [Ursula Franklin]'s [The Real World of
Technology] lectures from 1989. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I didn't
know about her work until the news of her passing went around in social media a
few weeks ago.

There are five lectures in all, each an hour long, which can be streamed
directly for free. I ended up downloading the mp3s that the flash player uses so
I could easily listen to them on my commute to work. If you'd like a copy <a
href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">get in touch</a>. If you prefer there is a [book]
too ... but you'll be missing out on Franklin's delivery, which is a big part of
the wit and warmth of the lectures.

The lectures are ultimately about re-centering technology on the needs of
people, rather than capital markets, the machinery of war, and natural
destruction. Even with a gap of 30 years her message still rings clear as a bell
today. We're in the middle of talking about principles or values at work,
so when Franklin talked about her own principles I wanted to jot them down. You
probably will need to listen to the lectures to get at the meaning behind words
like, but I imagine they will mostly make sense.

> I can't emphasize enough that we need a great deal of principled discourse.

> hearsay.  It should seek out those with *direct experience*, those on whom
> technology *impacts*.

> One needs also to pay particular attention to the language of this
> discourse. A lot of clarification can occur by simply *attending* to the
> language. Whenever somebody talks to you about benefits or costs of particular
> development don't ask *what* benefits, ask *whose* benefits, *whose* costs. To
> come back to the discourse that we have to have with each other: on the basis
> of these discussions we could make up a checklist ... let's make a civic list.
> When one looks at projects that are under discussion ... one can ask:
> 
> 1. Whether it promotes justice.
> 2. Whether it restores reciprocity.
> 3. Whether it confers divisible or individible benefits.
> 4. Whether it favors people over machines.
> 5. Whether the strategy of implementation maximizes gain or minimizes disaster.
> 6. Whether conservation is favored over waste.
> 7. Whether the irreversible stands back because the reversible is favored.
