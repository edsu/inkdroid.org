Science & Technology Studies (STS) is kind of a narrow field, but it comprises
quite a diverse set of theories that can be kinda hard to keep in your head at
one time. One STS idea I quite like is [Sheila Jasanoff]'s concept of
[Co-production], which like much work in STS, attempts to reconcile human agency
(the social) with technological determinism. This resolution is achieved by
saying that both produce each other, in a bit of circular logic that's similar
to how [Giddens] solves for subjective/objective duality using a form of
recursion.

In her introduction to States of Knowledge, Jasanoff has a nice
short segment that sums up a set of STS theories in the context of
co-production, that I think is useful for thinking about STS more generally
[@Jasanoff:2006, pp. 5-6]. I
wanted to jot it down here in case I go searching for a neat packaging of STS...
and I also wanted to make sure I had these books in my BibTeX database :-)
