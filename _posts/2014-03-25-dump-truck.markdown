    Were you in the cab or the bed?

    <p>In the cab, on the passenger side :-)</p>

<p>I had a strange dream last night.</p>
<p>I was working on a consulting project with an archivist friend, and a group of others I didn't know as well. I knew that the work was politically sensitive, and that it was important for some reason that escapes me now.</p>
<p>Before the work could start I was required to sign a document. I trusted my friend implicitly, and didn't really read it closely. Afterwards my friend let me know that I had signed a document stating that said I had committed suicide, and that I no longer legally existed. Apparently, this would provide a framework for the work to happen more easily.</p>
<p>I remember being concerned about my family. I walked outside to smoke a cigarette (something I don't do anymore). A few of the other people joined me, and we got in a dump truck.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don't know why, but I woke up from the dream feeling strangely relaxed. I looked up a few things in our our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreamers-Dictionary-Stearn-Robinson/dp/0446342963">cheesy dreamer's dictionary</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Archives.</strong> Anything to do with archives in a dream is a forerunner of unexpected legal entanglements.</p>
<p><strong>Document.</strong> Business or legal documents in a dream are usually a warning against speculations, unless the documents were in an indigenous place such as a notary or lawyer's office, in which case they portend a coming increase, possibly for inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Suicide.</strong> This dream is a signal that you need a change of scene or more mental relaxation. Try sharing your troubles with a trusted friend or adviser, but in any event stop brooding.</p>
<p><strong>Cigar (or Cigarette)</strong> Whether you were offering them, smoking yourself, or observing someone else with them, this form of tobacco in a dream is a lucky omen pertaining to prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there wasn't an entry for dump truck.</p>
