I decided to pull some of my [public Flickr posts](https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkdroid) into this blog. They will all get added with the [flickr](https://inkdroid.org/tag/flickr/) tag. If you subscribe to the feed and would prefer not to see these please [let me know](mailto:ehs@pobox.com). 

This blog is still created with Jekyll so I added [a small Ruby program](https://github.com/edsu/inkdroid.org/blob/main/_scripts/flickr.rb) to talk to the Flickr API. At the moment it only pulls them when I happen to be authoring/publishing a post, but I guess I could rustle up a GitHub Action that checks on some schedule.
