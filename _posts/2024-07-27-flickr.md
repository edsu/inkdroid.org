I decided to pull some of my [public Flickr posts](https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkdroid) into this blog. They will all get added with the [flickr](https://inkdroid.org/tag/flickr/) tag. If you subscribe to the feed and would prefer not to see these please [let me know](mailto:ehs@pobox.com). 

This blog is still created with Jekyll so I added [a small Ruby program](https://github.com/edsu/inkdroid.org/blob/main/_scripts/flickr.rb) to talk to the Flickr API. At the moment it only pulls them when I happen to be authoring/publishing a post, but I guess I could rustle up a GitHub Action that checks on some schedule.

Update: I since learned that the Indieweb community call this publishing pattern *Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site* ([PESOS]). Their wiki indicates that it is considered inferior to *Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere* ([POSSE]), for various reasons. However, for me, it's conceptually easier to pull various types of content than it is to compose one type of content and push it elsewhere.

Different platforms tend to have apps and editing functionality that affords the type of content that is being composed, and I have no plans on replicating that here. I'm still writing these posts in Vim and pushing with Rsync! But I do like being able to snap a photo on my phone and share it using the Flickr app.

Maybe someday I'll start pulling content from my [Mastodon] and [Pinboard] accounts, which is where I do most of my social media posting these days. But I wouldn't want to pull everything I post there, so I'd need to come up with some declarative pattern for that. Perhaps I could use a hashtag based solution, similar to how my [Pinboard posts tagged with #t] end up getting sent to Mastodon with [feediverse]...
