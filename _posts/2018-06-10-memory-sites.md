I recently got around to reading [Pierre Nora]'s classic paper about history and
memory, which archivists like to cite because of his claim that *modern memory
is archival* [@Nora:1989]. The paper is actually an English translation of the
introduction to his massive three volume work [Les Lieux de Mémoire]. I thought
I'd include the full quote here to make a few comments:

> Modern memory is, above all, archival. It relies entirely on 
> the materiality of the trace, the immediacy of the recording,
> the visibility of the image. What began as writing ends as 
> high fidelity and tape recording. The less memory is 
> experienced from the inside the more it exists only through
> its exterior scaffolding and outward signs--hence the obsession
> with the archive that marks our age, attempting at once the
> complete conservation of the present as well as the total 
> preservation of the past. Fear of a rapid disappearance
> combines with anxiety about the meaning of the present and
> uncertainty about the future to give even the most humble
> testimony, the most modest vestige, the potential 
> dignity of the memorable.

It's an interesting idea because of the way it implicates technology
(photography and sound recording) in our ideas about memory and the archive.
Nora is writing in 1989, after almost 200 years of development in photography
and recording technologies that led to television. In that same year Tim
Berners-Lee is taking his first steps at creating the World Wide Web at CERN.
Nora is interested in how technologies leave traces, which are records that we
*feel* we must keep. At least this is the leap that he claims we make, from
trace to record, which leads to an anxiety of the archive. I would argue that
this anxiety about collection existed well before the advent of photography and
sound recording. The technologies of text and print, which made the traces of
speech recordable inevitably led us to worry about what documents need to be
preserved...or to unquestioningly record the words of the powerful.  One
technique archivists have developed for easing this anxiety is through the
practice of appraisal.

Anxiety about record production actually masks another kind of anxiety, which
Nora doesn't quite speak to explicitly here. It is an anxiety about *who*
records -- or *whose* traces are to be made archival. As the means of trace
production have become widely available so has the number of people that are
peripherally engaged in archival work. The camera enabled the generation of
boxes of photographs, and albums, which are in effect miniature archives which
may find their way into larger ones. The [Records Continuum], and specifically
post-custodial archival theory [@Upward:1997 ; @Upward:1996], allow us to
examine this production and movement of records in a way that generously
enlarges, or even democratizes, the scope of archival work. This enlargement
works to ameliorate the anxiety about the archive by allowing archival processes
to extend out into the world.

But Nora isn't interested in the archive here as much as he is in the topic of
*lieux de mémoire* or places of memory. It's the subject of the three volumes he
is introducing. As an example of a place of memory he examines the [French
Revolutionary Calendar], which was an attempt to remove royalist and religious
influence in the calendar.  Nora points out that the calendar itself was a
failure, because France is still using the Gregorian years. But some events are
remembered for their placement on the calendar ...  and so the calendar becomes
a place of memory.

But places of memory are not simply collections of traces or records that have survived over time--agency or the will to remember is what distinguishes simply a collection of traces, from a lieux du mémoire.

It is this will to remember which is what allows places of memory to exist. Memory sites are not something that technologies, records or media do alone -- they require interpretation by *people*. Memory is social. Nora is stressing the role of people in memory, and trying to disabuse us of the idea that memory can be found in physical traces alone. When distinguishing between *true* memory and *historical* memory in the lead up to the quote about all memory being archival above he says:

> Of course, we still cannot do without the word \[memory\], but we

> as a duty, no longer spontaneous; psychological, individual,
> and subjective; but never social, collective, or all 
> encompassing. How did we move from the first memory, which is
> immediate, to the second? (p. 13)

Honestly, I find this distinction Nora is making hard to grasp. I read a translation, so perhaps returning to the French would provide some insight into what is going on here. But what Nora seems to be saying is that memory is embodied and made part of social practices, whereas modern memory, or archival memory, is formulaic, and technocratic. This seems out of place with todays technologies of trace production, namely the web where records are highly dynamic and social. Nora's perspective on archival memory seems much more concerned with traditional mass media technologies such as newspapers and television which intentionally push particular narratives and framings, than with social media where stories can be shared, commented upon, and made part of conversation--pushed and pulled [@Brown:2010]. However these systems of conversation are still designed and governed by structures that allow particular actions, but prevent others. In many ways Nora's idea of lieux de mémoire acts intervenes into the arhivalization of everything, by suggesting that our traces need to be made social to become sites of memory.  

Would Nora think that Facebook was a site of memory? Or would it be something else? @Hoskins:2018a sees social media sites like Facebook not as a memory site, or as collective memory, but as the *memory of the multitudes*:

> The new economy of attention or distraction--the multiple
> and often simultaneous modes of being hyperconnected:

Hoskins emphasis on the sociotechnical reality of memory seems apt now, but also seems apt for 1987 when Nora is writing. It is the distinction that Nora seems to be making between the human and the non-human world of technology that bugs me the most. This position seems at odds with perspectives that put the human and non-human into relation, rather than putting them into a hierarchy. I'm thinking about Actor Network Theory here [@Latour:1979]. Still the idea that there are sites of memory, and even objects of memory, and that they are rendered such through social interaction still seems like a useful and valuable insight. I just think Nora downplays the degree to which institutions like archives, and document traces, have social lives.
