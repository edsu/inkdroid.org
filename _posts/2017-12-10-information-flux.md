@Bossewitch:2012 contains a useful description of *information flux* which is a
conceptual framework for thinking about the flow of information between an
individual and a network with respect to knowledge and power. The authors build
on well known analyses of surveillance and the  panopticon [@Foucault:2012] to
provide additional *blueprints* or strategies of information transfer, and a
method for means for generating them.

This makes it sound complicated but really it's just a method of diagramming how
information moves in a system between various parties and giving the pattern a
name.

It's interesting how power is written into these blueprints (encoded as multiple As and a singular B),
particularly how less powerful parties can become powerful over time due to the
information flux that is at play. They also talk about how information flux is a
reductionist technique, in that it does not speak necessarily of values, which
are lost when simply representing the transfers.

I thought this idea was particularly compelling and useful when considering
the work I've been a part of with [Documenting the Now], which is attempting to
position research and archival practices for social media. The companies of
Twitter and Facebook our powerful parties, but the archives are powerful as well
when considering their interactions with the voices that are present in social
media. Those same voices, collectively, also have power that they can exert.
Anyway, these are just notes to remind myself later of this useful concept--and
share it with you if you are interested as well.

Now that I think about it the paper reminds me quite a bit of a [talk] [Hillel
Arnold] gave at SAA back in 2014 during a panel [A Trickle Becomes a Flood:
Agency, Ethics and Information] that I participated in.
