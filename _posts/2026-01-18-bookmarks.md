      How To Start a Permacomputing Collective
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    This is a guide brewed from conversations with initiatives in London (UK), Berlin (DE), Prague (CZ), Philadelphia (USA), Rotterdam (NL), Vienna (AT), Lutruwtia (Tas/AU), County Mayo (IE) and a community from Middle America gathering on servers. This text can support you when starting a permacomputing collective. We use fermenting as a metaphor. It isn’t a strict recipe but more of a loose framework that can be freely modified to suit local tastes and conditions. Many actions are cyclical and can be seen as opportunities to revisit or re-purpose later.

    Le Sommet pour l’action sur l’intelligence artificielle se tient à Paris du 6 au 11 février 2025. C’est l’occasion de rappeler l’existence d’une boîte à outils pour révéler les angles morts des discours sur le numérique. Autour du concept d’« impensé numérique », ces outils de compréhension sont précieux pour garder la tête froide face à l’irruption de l’IA générative dans notre quotidien.

  <section class="p-summary">
    We analyzed 470 open-source GitHub pull requests, including 320 AI-co-authored PRs and 150 human-only PRs, using CodeRabbit’s structured issue taxonomy. Every finding was normalized to issues per 100 PRs and we used statistical rate ratios to compare how often different types of problems appeared in each group.

The results? Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also amplifies certain categories of mistakes.

      F3: The Open-Source Data File Format for the Future
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Columnar storage formats are the foundation for modern data analytics systems. The proliferation of open-
source file formats (i.e., Parquet, ORC) allows seamless data sharing across disparate platforms. However, these
formats were created over a decade ago for hardware and workload environments that are much different
from today. Although these formats have incorporated some updates to their specification to adapt to these
changes, not all deployments support those modifications, and too often systems cannot overcome the formats’
deficiencies and limitations without a rewrite.
In this paper, we present the F uture-proof F ile Format (F3) project. It is a next-generation open-source
file format with interoperability, extensibility, and efficiency as its core design principles. F3 obviates the
need to create a new format every time a shift occurs in data processing and computing by providing a data
organization structure and a general-purpose API to allow developers to add new encoding schemes easily.
Each self-describing F3 file includes both the data and meta-data, as well as WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries
to decode the data. Embedding the decoders in each file requires minimal storage (kilobytes) and ensures
compatibility on any platform in case native decoders are unavailable. To evaluate F3, we compared it against
legacy and state-of-the-art open-source file formats. Our evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of F3’s storage
layout and the benefits of Wasm-driven decoding.

  <section class="p-summary">
    Tsing and Zhou instead prefer to describe FUNGI: Anarchist Designers as an exhibition of ‘anti-design’. In this show, fungi are not passive building materials, but rather anarchic co-designers – unconscious and uncontrollable – of a world that can only exist through alliances between humans and other living things. The exhibition reveals how fungi manifest themselves at different scales, from sick frogs and the dishwasher in your kitchen, to hospital beds, termite mounds, the human digestive system, coffee, banana and conifer plantations, and the jungle.

      Beyond Vector Search: Why LLMs Need Episodic Memory

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Here’s what I keep coming back to: in any mature system, most of the graph will be memories of memories. You ask me my favorite restaurants, I think about it, answer, and now “that list I made” becomes its own retrievable thing. Next time someone asks about dinner plans, I don’t re-derive preferences from first principles. I remember what I concluded last time. Psychologists say this is how human recall actually works; you’re not accessing the original, you’re accessing the last retrieval. Gets a little distorted each time.

      Digital Archiving for Just Transitions

  <section class="p-summary">
    In 2023, I returned to Taiwan for further social science research focused on environmental activism in response to the pollution caused by Formosa Plastics, one of the biggest plastics companies in the world, headquartered in Taiwan. One thread of research upon my return extended an initiative that I’ve come to call “Archiving Formosa Plastics”, designed to study environmental justice and governance issues related to the company across diverse settings, supporting various research, advocacy, and teaching endeavours. 

The project started after getting to know an anti-Formosa activist in Texas named Diane Wilson. Since the Texas Formosa Plant started operations in the late 1980s, Wilson has collected many kinds of documents about the plant, eventually needing a large barn to store them all. I had many questions about these documents: When and how did these various documents gain and lose political value? Who would take care of and steward these documents into the future

    A couple of days ago I wrote about ActivityPub becoming a W3C Recommendation. This was one output of the Social Working Group, and the blogpost was about my experiences, and most of my experiences were on my direct work on ActivityPub. But the Social Working Group did more than ActivityPub; it also on the same day published WebSub, a useful piece of technology in its own right which amongst other things also plays a significant historical role in what is even ActivityPub's history (but is not used by ActivityPub itself), and it has also published several documents which are not compatible with ActivityPub at all, and appear to play the same role. This, to outsiders, may appear confusing, but there are reasons which I will go into in this post

  <section class="p-summary">
    We are part of a growing global effort to ensure innovative technologies serve Indigenous communities and their environmental priorities. As AI rapidly becomes even more ubiquitous, Western science should look to Indigenous experts to guide the development of ethical AI tools for conservation in ways that assert their own goals, priorities and cautions.

Responsible AI that benefits Indigenous communities and conservation must implement Indigenous data sovereignty principles, and determine how and if Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge should be incorporated into these systems. AI that is co-designed with Indigenous partners, rather than for them, can make these technologies more accessible, culturally appropriate and aligned with community goals

Entire hobby communities that spent years of work discussing things, answering questions, a wealth of information… gone.

  <section class="p-summary">
    Indigenous math isn't just about numbers and equations, it involves culture, spirituality and more. Math professor Edward Doolittle, a Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, sees math as something embedded in Creation itself. In his Hagey Lecture at the University of Waterloo, he describes Indigenous mathematics as being grounded in cognition, emotion, the physical world and community. Indigenizing math, Doolittle hopes, will make it more approachable and meaningful to Indigenous students — show them how entwined it is with everyday life and something much bigger than ourselves

    While AI is undeniably good at writing code, it remains poor at architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot, believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who understands the underlying principles of the craft.
