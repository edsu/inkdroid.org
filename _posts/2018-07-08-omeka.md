If you have some old [Omeka] sites that are still valuable resources, but are no
longer being actively maintained, you might want to consider converting them to
a static site along with the PHP code and database. This means that the site can
stay online in much the form that it's in now, at the same URLs, and you still
have the code and database to bring it back if you want to. From a maintenance
perspective this is a big win since you no longer have the problem of keeping
the PHP, Omeka and MySQL code up to date and backed up. The big trade off is
that the site becomes truly static. Making any changes across the static assets
would be quite tedious. So only consider this if you really anticipate that the
project is no longer being actively curated.

I have done this a few times with man Wordpress sites, but Omeka is a little bit
different in a few ways so I thought it was worth a quick blog post to jot down
some steps.

### Disable Search

This is kind of important for usability. Since there will no longer be any
server side PHP code and database for it to query, there's unfortunately no way
to have a search form on your Omeka site. This may be a deal break for you,
depending on how you are using the search. The good news however is that people
can still find your site via Google, DuckDuckGo, or some other search engine.

To disable search take a look in your Omeka theme, often in `common/header.php`
and simply comment out the code that generates the search form:

```html
<!-- <?php //echo simple_search(); ?> -->
```

It might be nice to be able to generate a static [Lunr.js] index for your
database and drop it into your Omeka site before creating the static version.
This an approach that the minimal computing project [Wax] has taken, and should
work well for average size collections. Or perhaps you could configure a [Google
Custom Search Engine], and similarly drop that into your Omeka before
conversion. But it may be easiest to simply accept that some functionality will
be lost as part of the archiving process.

### Localize External Resources

It's fairly common to use JavaScript and CSS files from various CDNs. To find
them iew the source of one of your Omeka pages and scan for `http` to review the
types of JavaScript and CSS files that might be needed for the pages to work
properly.  If you find any try downloading them into your theme and then
updating your theme to reference them there.

### Use Slash URLs

This one is kind of esoteric, but could be important. Most Omeka installs don't
use trailing slashes on URLs, for example:

```text
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121
```

The problem with this is that when you use a tool like [wget] to mirror a
website it will download those pages using a `.html` extension:

```text
archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121.html
archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items.html
```

This works just fine when you mount it on the web, but if anyone has linked to
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121 they will get a 404 Not
Found.

One way around this is to convert your application URLs to end in a slash prior
to creating your mirror. You can do this by modifying the `url` function which
can be found in `libraries/globals.php` or in `application/helpers/Url.php` in
older versions of Omeka. This [issue ticket] has some more details.

Then your URLs will look like this:

```text
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121/
```

and will be saved by wget as:

```
archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/index.html
archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121/index.html
```

Then when someone comes asking for an old link like:

```text
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121
```

Apache will happily redirect them to:

```text
https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/items/show/121/
```

and serve up the `index.html` that's there. Whew. Yeah, all that for a for a
forward slash. But if links are important to you it might be worth the code
spelunking to get it working.

### Do the Crawl

I've used [wget] for this in the past. It's a venerable tool, that has been
battle hardened over the years. It won't execute JavaScript in your pages, but
most Omeka applications don't rely too heavily on that -- it could be a problem
if you use this approach to archive other types of sites.

The one problem with wget is it has many, many options, many of which interact
in weird ways. Here's an example wget command I use:

```text
wget \
  --output-file $log \
  --warc-file $name \
  --mirror \
  --page-requisites \
  --html-extension \
  --convert-links \
  --wait 1 \
  --execute robots=off \
  --no-parent $url 2>/dev/null
```

This is *painful* so I've developed a little helper utility I call [bagweb] so I
don't need to remember the options and what they do every time I want to mirror
a website. The `--warc-file` option will also create a [WARC] file as it goes if
you tell it too, which can be useful, as we'll see in a second. You run bagweb
giving it a URL and a name to use for a new directory that will contain a
[BagIt] package:

```text
% bagweb https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org bga
```

This will run for a while writing a log to bga.log. Once it's done you'll see a
directory structure like this:

```text
% tree bga
bga
â”œâ”€â”€ bag-info.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ bagit.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bga.warc.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ archive.blackgothamarchive.org.tar.gz
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest-md5.txt
â””â”€â”€ tagmanifest-md5.txt
```

You can zip up that directory or copy it to an archive. But before we do that let's test them.

### Test!

You can unpack your mirrored website and make sure they work properly using [Docker] to easily start up an Apache instance:

```text
tar xvfz bga/data/archive.blackgothamarchive.org.tar.gz
cd archive.blackgothamarchive.org
docker run -v `pwd`:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs -p 8080:80 httpd
```

And then turn off your Internet connection (wi-fi, ethernet, whatevs) and visit this URL in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

You should see your Omeka site! For extra points you can download 
[Webrecorder Player] and open the generated WARC file and interact with it that way.

### Install

Now that you have your static version of the website you need to move it up to your production web server. That should be as simple as copying the tarball up to a &lt;DocumentRoot&gt; configuration.

You may also want to create a tarball of the Omeka server side code and a MySQL
dump of the Omeka database to save in your bag. It's probably worth noting some
details about external dependencies in the `bag-info.txt` such as the version
of Apache, PHP, MySQL and the operating system type/version for anyone
courageous enough to try to get the code running again in the future.

So, hardly a walk in the park. But if the Omeka environment is at risk for whatever reason this is a pretty satisfying process that ensures that the data is preserved, and still available on the web for people to use.
