As the World Wide Web has become a prominent, if not the predominant, form of
global communications and publishing over the last 25 years we have seen the
emergence of web archiving as an increasingly important activity. The web is an
immensely large and constantly changing information landscape that fundamentally
resists the idea of "archiving it all" [@Masanes:2006]. The web is also a site
for constant breakdown in the form of broken links, failed business models,
unsustainable infrastructure, obsolescence and general neglect. Web archiving
projects work in varying measures to stem this tide of loss--to save what is
deemed worth saving before it is 404 Not Found. In many ways you can think
of web archiving as a form of repair or maintenance work that is conducted by archivists in collaboration with each other, as well as tools and infrastructures.

In this presentation I will quickly describe some research I've been
doing into how web archives are constructed and why I think it matters for
historians of technology. What follows is essentially what [@Brugger:2012a]
calls a *web historiography*: it's a story that focuses on the users of a
*technology of history* rather than a *history of a technology*.  

By *web archives* I specifically mean archives *of* web content, not necessarily
archives that are *on* the web. Brügger distinguishes between three types of
content that can be found on the web:

* *digitized*: content that has been converted to digital format by some means (image scanning, transcription, etc) and then placed on the web.
* *born-digital*: content that is created digital (word processor files, blog posts, social media, digital photographs, etc) and can be naturally found on the web.
* *reborn-digital*: is *digitized* or *born-digital* content that has been collected and preserved from the web, and then re-presented as part of a web archive.

It is this third category of *reborn-digital* content that I'm concerned with
here. A prime example is the Internet Archive, which I imagine some of you have
used as a source of material in your own research. There are now thousands of
entities around the world collecting web content for a variety of archival
purposes.

The question of *what* and *how* web content ends up in an archive is of great
[historiographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography) significance,
because what we know of the past is necessarily shaped by the evidence of the
past that survives into the present. Since it is physically impossible to
archive everything, archives have always contained gaps or silences.
@Trouillot:1995 provides a framework for thinking about these moments in which
these silences enter the archive:

> Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments:
> the moment of fact creation (the making of sources): *the moment of fact
> assembly (the making of archives)*; the moment of fact retrieval (the making
> of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making
> of history in the final instance).

Given the significance of the making of archives to the making of history, and the abundance of material on the web, how do archivists decide what to
save?

Archivists have traditionally used the term *appraisal* to describe the process by which they identify materials that they think are of enough
enduring value to care for in an archive. While notions of value, and the
methods for measuring it differ, the activity of appraisal is central to the
work of the archivist. To further specify this moment in which content becomes
archival @Ketelaar:2001 introduced the neologism *archivalization* as

> the conscious or unconscious choice (determined by social and
> cultural factors) to consider something worth archiving. Archivalization
> precedes archiving. The searchlight of archivalization has to sweep the
> world for something to light up in the archival sense, before we can
> proceed to register, to record, to inscribe it, in short  before we
> archive it.

In order to better understand this process of *lighting up* web content in web
archives I conducted 30 interviews with web archivists, software developers,
researchers and activists to discover how they decide to preserve web content.
Inspired by the work of researchers such as @Suchman:1985, @Star:1999 and
@Kelty:2008 these were [ethnographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography)
interviews that aimed to develop a thick description of how practitioners enact
appraisal in their particular work environments.

In the first pass at analysis I coded the the jottings and field notes
generated. These provided a detailed pictures of the sociotechnical environment
in which this work is being performed [@Summers:2017]. However questions still
remained about the psychological or social nature of the decision making process
around moments of archivalization in web archives.

On a second pass at analysis I performed a [critical discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis) on the
interview transcripts. Critical discourse analysis was selected because it
offers a theoretical framework for analyzing the way in which participants' use
of language reflects identity formation, figured worlds and communities of
practice, while also speaking to the larger sociocultural context that web
archiving work is taking place within.

> A Discourse is a socially accepted association among ways of using
> language, of thinking, feeling, believing, valuing, and of acting that
> can be used to identify oneself as a member of a socially meaningful
> group or 'social network', or to signal (that one is playing) a socially
> meaningful 'role'. [@Gee:2015, p. 143]

Gee's 7 building tasks provide a framework for examining the ways in which
language is used as a tool to shape the social world of web archiving work, and
also the ways in which the social context of archival work in turn shapes the
use of language by its practitioners. These tasks include:

* *Significance*: how is language used to foreground and background certain
  things?
* *Activities*: how is language being used to enact particular activities?
* *Identity*: how is language being used to position specific identities and
  make them recognizable?
* *Relationships*: what relationships are signaled in the use of language?
* *Politics*: how are notions of of value and norms established in the use of
  language?
* *Connections*: how is language used to connect and disconnect ideas,
  activities,
  objects?
* *Sign systems and knowledge*: how does language position (privilege or
  disprivilege) particular sign systems, or ways of knowing and believing?

There's not enough time to get into all the details of my findings here, but I
thought I would provide you with a brief look at what this analysis looks like
as a way of introducing my key findings. All the names used in the
transcriptions are pseudonyms in order to allow the participants to be
themselves as much as possible without fear of repercussions from their
employer.

Here I am interviewing Jim, who works at a non-profit web archiving organization.

I selected this snippet because it highlights how discourse reflects the
*relationships* that are involved in the appraisal process. Just before this
snippet Jim is talking about how he wasn't sure whether a particular video
streaming site could be archived because of the amount of data involved. He
sought the advice of his immediate supervisor Ariana, who then brought in Alex,
who is the Director of the archive. It turned out that the Director had a
connection with a staff person who was working at the video streaming company,
who could provide key information about the amount of data that needed to be
archived. Here Jim is using the hierarchical, chain-of-command relationships to
lend weight and formality to what is actually a much richer set of circular
relationships within the organization. The relationships also extended outside
the archive and into the organization that had created the video content.

We see this pattern reflected in another interview with Jack, who is an archivist at a large university, who has been working to document the activities of the fracking industry within his state.j

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here Jack is explicitly describing "connections" or relationships as an
essential part of his job as an archivist. Just before this snippet he had
finished describing how he got the idea to document fracking from a web
archivist at another institution, who was already engaged in documenting
fracking in his tate. Jack's interest in documenting environmental issues had
developed while working with a mentor at a previous university. Jack wanted to
collaborate with this archivist to better document fracking activity as it
extends across geopolitical boundaries. He sought the approval from the
Associate Dean of the Library who was very supportive of the idea. However as
this snippet illustrates Jack sees these professional relationships as necessary
but not sufficient for doing the work. He sees dialogue with the communities
being documented, in this case activist communities, as an important dimension
to the work of web archiving.

In addition to focusing on relationships Gee's Making Strange Tool is a
discourse analysis technique for foregrounding what might otherwise slip into
the background:

> In any communication, listeners/readers should try to act as if they
> were outsiders.

The use of *crawling and selecting* on line 2 is a phrase that Jack uses several
times in the interview. *Crawling* refers to the behavior of software used to
collect content from the web. The software that is used to do this is
originally referred to as a *web spider* because of the way it automatically and
recursively follows links in web content for some period of time. But web spiders need to be told by a person where to begin *crawling*, which
is the process of *selection*.

If you are thinking that selection and appraisal sound similar that's because
they are practically synonyms for each other. Both terms are concerned with
identifying material that is of enduring value for preservation in an archive.
*Appraisal* speaks to the theory, method or framework that is used for
performing the activity of *selection*.

In physical archives, boxes of paper manuscripts, files, diskettes or hard
drives change hands. A retiring researcher donates their personal papers or
workstation to an archive. Or a particular business unit transfers a set of
material to an archive according to a previously agreed upon record retention
program. In either case a relationship between the record creator or owner and
the archive is established. This relationship is intrinsic to the appraisal
process.

But in web archives this material transaction is not necessary or it is
transformed almost beyond recognition. The architecture and infrastructure of
the web, as well as the underlying Internet, allow content to be instantly
retrieved across vast distances. All you need to know is the URL for the
resource and to point your web client (be it a browser or a *crawler*) in that
direction. When it is all working. As noted by @Brügger:2012b the reliability of
archived copies of web content is not a given. Features of the HTTP protocol,
such as cookies [@Barth:2011] and caching [@Fielding:2014] combined with the
rendering capabilities of the client software mean that the idea of a single
idealized, canonical representation of a web resource retreats from view. And of
course the seeming immateriality of web content is an illusion generated by the
very real assemblage of physical networks, computer machinery, storage devices,
electrical grids and cooling units that must operate in concert to deliver
access.

</figure>

As we saw with Jack, there is no need to enter into a conversation with a
website owner to start archiving web content. When the content is on the the
public web an archivist can start the archiving software, give it a URL,
configure the crawling behavior (how far, how long, how much, etc) and let it do
its work. The decision of what to crawl is detached from the relationships that
have traditionally guided appraisal. But like a ghost limb, Jack still felt the
significance of these connections between the archive and the content creators
for doing archival work. He wanted to establish them, even if they were not
technically necessary. The links of relationships between people have
effectively been replaced by hypertext links that provide discoverability and access.

In many ways what this analysis seems to point to is an evolving practice of web
archiving where traditional concepts of appraisal are being unbracketed from one
context and reapplied in another. Focusing on the objects, be they paper files,
boxes, or representations of HTTP transactions, is less at issue than the
practices that involve those objects. A practice orientation recalls Annemarie
Mol's field study work observing the treatment of atherosclerosis, which
multiple realities.

> It is possible to refrain from understanding objects as the central focus
> of different people's perspectives. It is possible to understand them
> instead as things manipulated in *practices*. If we do this--if instead of
> bracketing the practices in which objects are handled we foreground
> them--this has far reaching effects. Reality multiplies. [@Mol:2002, p. 5]

The archive is situated among these multiple record realities involving the
creators of records with the preservers of records with the users of records.

But to return to the question I started with: what does all this tell us about
how content is appraised for websites, and historiography of the web? I think
these brief examples highlight just how important it is to maintain the manifold
of relationships between record creators and the archive. Appraisal, as it is
embodied in the practices of archivists, and encoded into software tools, is a
social enterprise that shapes the historical record. Just as the infrastructure
of the web enables communication across great geographic  distances, it also
paradoxically moves to obscure the relationship between the archive and the
archived. Practices that help bridge this gap and make it legible, while
allowing for new methods of appraisal to evolve are needed.

If you're a scholar who uses archives of web content I encourage you to reach
out to the archivists at your respective organizations and to work with them to
help build these practices and ensure that they are collecting the things you
value. If you work as part of an organization and want to ensure that your web
content is being collected and archives try reaching out to an archivist to let
them know of your interest. And of course if you are an archivist and you are
stymied by thinking about archiving web content, there are good reasons for
that. The web is a big place, and its hard to know what to collect. Maintaining relationship
