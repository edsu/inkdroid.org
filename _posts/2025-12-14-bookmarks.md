  <section class="p-summary">
    Harnessing artificial intelligence, the Harvard Art Museums have gathered 71,035,440 machine-generated descriptions and tags for 387,885 images from across their collections. Using techniques such as object recognition and face analysis—which estimates gender, age, and emotion—this data offers insights into how computers perceive and interpret a wide range of artworks and objects.

    On Wednesday, Micron Technology announced it will exit the consumer RAM business in 2026, ending 29 years of selling RAM and SSDs to PC builders and enthusiasts under the Crucial brand. The company cited heavy demand from AI data centers as the reason for abandoning its consumer brand, a move that will remove one of the most recognizable names in the do-it-yourself PC upgrade market

  <section class="p-summary">
    AI models not only point some users to false sources but also cause problems for researchers and librarians, who end up wasting their time looking for requested nonexistent records, says Library of Virginia chief of researcher engagement Sarah Falls. Her library estimates that 15 percent of emailed reference questions it receives are now ChatGPT-generated, and some include hallucinated citations for both published works and unique primary source documents. “For our staff, it is much harder to prove that a unique record doesn’t exist,” she says

      Moats and AI Revisited

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    What business models and positioning are defensible in an AI-powered world? What moats will remain as AI grows more capable? Over the past few months I’ve put these questions to everyone who will listen, and then some, and incorporated the compelling answers into my list. It’s time for a recap.

The list remains short, though the headings are broad. I speak to many entrepreneurs and business operators and ask myself whether their offerings fall under one or more of these headings. The vast majority do not. That says to me that they will be overtaken by AI developments. Maybe they will last 12 or 18 months, but it won’t be long.

    I think it’s somewhat misunderstood what’s going on, but nevertheless, I sometimes say “a data center full of GPUs is like a warehouse full of bananas, that’s got a relatively short half life in terms of its usefulness.” That’s important to keep in mind. That’s what makes it different from prior CapEx spending. Moments like railroads, canals, rural electrification, take your pick, because of the nature of the perished ability of the thing that we’re investing in.

    Common Lisp is old, and its inspiration is even older. It was developed when there was zero consensus on how file systems worked, operating systems were more incompatible than you can probably imagine, and that age shows. It pinned down terminology way before other languages got to the same point, and, as it happens so often, the late arrivals decided that they needed different words and these words stuck

    What might today’s educators learn from the Luddites? How can their strategies help us navigate our own moment of technological disruption? Here, we offer three approaches to Luddite praxis, inspired by the clothworkers’ resistance — not as prescriptions, but as starting points for shaping our own responses to automation’s incursions into schools.

      The Best Experimental Music of 2025

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Welcome to the year-end edition of Best Experimental Music on Bandcamp, in which we’ve picked 12 of our favorites from 2025. Once again, all kinds of amazing experimental music appeared on Bandcamp this year, and it was our immense pleasure to listen to as much of it as we could, and pass our favorites along to you. There were hundreds of releases that could’ve made this list, but we trust that whatever the style, whomever the artist, and whatever the story behind their music is, you’ll find something to love. Presented in alphabetical order by artist, our selections include avant-rock, longform drone, vocal explorations, and cello narratives.

      Modelling Scenarios for Carbon-aware Geographic Load Shifting of Compute Workloads
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    We present an analytical model to evaluate the reductions in emissions resulting from geographic load shifting. This model is optimistic as it ignores issues of grid capacity, demand and curtailment. In other words, real-world reductions will be smaller than the estimates. However, even with these assumptions, the presented scenarios show that the realistic reductions from carbon-aware geographic load shifting are small, of the order of 5\%. This is not enough to compensate the growth in emissions from global data centre expansion.

      You Can’t Fight Fascism While Defunding Libraries
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    We are living through a coordinated assault on knowledge. In a moment when Big Tech is waging war on complex thought, a fascist government is targeting higher education, and the media landscape is being demolished by the same oligarchs driving this era of smash-and-grab politics, libraries are under-appreciated outposts of struggle, sharing and survival. They are sites of refuge, where curiosity is nurtured, where people find shelter, education, entertainment, job assistance, skill-building programs, and access to resources that would otherwise be out of reach. “We do it all at the library,” Sara Heymann, a library associate in the Chicago Public Library (CPL) system, recently told me. “We do a lot of arts, science, and literacy programming. We host movie nights. We have programs for helping people with their taxes, small businesses, and mental health. We help people.”
