<p>So on March 1st <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200603.mbox/%3c4405FBCE.9090506@apache.org%3e">lucene v1.9</a> was released and the *next day* <a href="http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/pylucene-dev/2006-March/000873.html">pylucene v1.9</a> is released. Nice work!</p>
<p>I guess there are a bunch of methods that are deprecated in 1.9 which will dissappear entirely in v2.0. Now would be a good time to update usage...</p>
