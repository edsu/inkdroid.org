Something has been troubling me about Cliff Lynch's recent [Stewardship in the
Age of Algorithms] and I think the source can be found early on:

> By "document" here, I mean to capture a comprehensive record, or at least 
> a good approximation, of the present reality that can be consulted today 
> and brought forward into the future [@Lynch:2017].

Even couched in the uncertainty of *approximation* I still think this idea of
the archive documenting *reality* is worrisome. Archives serve purposes. If we
aren't explicit about these purposes, and instead simply talk about how
effectively they document reality, then we're not really doing our job.
Sometimes the purposes that documentation are put to change over time
[@Ketelaar:2005b]. But even then it is important to know the original context to
put those records to new uses. In this paper Lynch moves to carve out a space
that is distinct from the interests of accountability and transparency, but
doesn't *really* describe what this space is.

Lynch also claims to be offering up *pragmatic* approaches several times in this
piece. The word is used 11 times by my count. But the key measure of the
pragmatic stance (at least in the [philosophical sense]) is the degree to which
something is useful.

Documenting reality is not a use. Instead it's important to ask:

* What purposes does the documentation serve *right now*?
* What effects will that documentation have, *right now*?

Once we are clear on answers these questions *then* we can talk about what
purposes the documentation might serve in the future. If we are always reaching
for an archive that *documents reality* then we will remain frustrated by
failure, and worse, we won't really know what we are doing, and who we are doing
it for.

To be fair, Lynch does go on to offer some pragmatic solutions, which are mostly
pulled from @Sandvig:2014. But Sandvig et al are specifically interested in
issues of accountability and transparency. Lynch uses these methods as a
launching off point, but we're not really sure where we're launching off to.

Now I'm as guilty as anyone for [gesturing] at imaginary future users who will
want to know that *something* happened. But let's face it, it's not a very
satisfying explanation of why we build archives is it? Who is the documentation
being collected for? How is the documentation scoped and why?  It feels like
there is an undercurrent of positivism in Lynch's approach to the problem of
archiving in this age of algorithms, which is at odds with the last 30 years, or
more [@Briet:2006], of archival thinking around documentation and appraisal.

Incidentally, I recently ran across @Jeurgens:2017 who also stresses the need to
document algorithms but from a more theoretical standpoint. I find the
connections Jeurgens makes to governmentality, sociality and the archival
concept of appraisal are much more generative for thinking about possible ways
of scoping the problem of the archive in these algorithmic times. He highlights
ways that archival concepts themselves are shifting. Plus, he cites Deleuze
which is always fun. I guess that means I'm a hopeless academic at this point.
*Help!* You heard it here first.
