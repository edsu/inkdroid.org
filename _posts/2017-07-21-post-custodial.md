I love how @Kelleher:2017 positions the radical? idea of funding the development
of archival infrastructure where it is actually needed using such a logical
appeal to the status quo:

> One strategy that UTL employed in collaboration with project partners to
> address challenges of agency, differential access to resources, and the most
> direct application of benefit was very deliberate transactional use of project
> funding. Rather than assume transfer of documentation to UTL — either through
> donation or purchase — as required under the custodial paradigm, UTL instead
> helped to arrange and purchased negotiated access to documentation that
> remained in the custody or control of the partner organization. Project funds
> were put toward the arrangement, description, preservation, and digitization 
> of documentation, just as they would have been if the archival materials 
> were at UTL. But the investments were made not in Texas, but locally with 
> the partner organizations. In this way, the partner organizations and in 
> some cases communities were able to build infrastructure and skills in 
> digitization, metadata, software development, and preservation appropriate 
> to the context of their organizational goals and uses of the documentation. 
> And in two cases at least, the human rights organization developed 
> significant local expertise that served them well beyond their partnership 
> with UTL. *Additionally, rather than acquire the original records themselves 
> — as called for under the custodial paradigm — UTL sometimes purchased 
> digitized copies of documentation or gained non-exclusive access to 
> documentation as they and partners made it available online. Though somewhat 
> unusual for a custodial archival repository, this system was very familiar 
> and comfortable for UTL as an academic library that annually spent hundreds 
> of thousands of dollars for access to databases.* Partner organizations, 
> with funds earned in this manner, could and did hire and train, or otherwise 
> provide direct humanitarian aid to individuals documented in the records, 
> so at least some saw benefit from participation in the project.
