  content: I've only JUST looked at the new calendar stuff, but Google does support
    iCal and some sort of XML feed (Atom?). Surely those are standards, and have proven
    more useful to date than microformats? That's not to say they can't do better
    of course.

  content: Yeah, totally -- that's why I thought the initial reaction about hCalendar
    was a bit premature.

  content: At this point, microformats are just a bunch of wiki pages, not an "open
    standard" (they're open, just not standards).  Furthermore, Google offers RSS,
    iCal, and configurable HTML feeds for the calendars--how much more open do you
    want them to get?

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/"><img src="http://www.google.com/calendar/images/calendar_sm2.gif" border="0" align="left" style="margin-right:15px" /></a>So it's been <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-April/thread.html#3661">noted</a> elsewhere that the latest ajaxy application out of google labs (<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a>) lacks support for the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> microformat.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's an oversight--but with all the high profile <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/etech_ray_ozzie.html">exposure</a> microformats have been getting lately it's kind of hard to imagine. But people have deadlines and some things just can't make it into the first release--even at Google. The main thing, as Mark Pilgrim says is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sniping from the sidelines makes us look petty and insular.  Instead<br />
of making assumptions about big bad evil Google ignoring open<br />
standards and locking users in, have we tried opening a dialogue?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know anyone at google so I feel like I'm doing my part by just blogging about how <em>awesome</em> it would be if they marked up their calendar data using hCalendar. As a full featured calendaring application on the web, Google Calendar could really enable  downstream applications like the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060720020831/http://spaces.msn.com:80/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">LiveClipboard</a> if they simply added some class attributes and spans to the data they are already displaying.</p>
<p>In the long run I imagine it's in Google's best interests to promote microformats since their infrastructure would allow them to take best advantage of a system of distributed metadata. Here's to hoping that it'll be layered in sometime soon. In the meantime <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-April/003669.html">Scott and Mark</a> have the right idea!</p>
<p>By the way, being able to enter a quick event in free text and have the time/location/description parsed as opposed to tabbing around in a complicated form is very nice.</p>
