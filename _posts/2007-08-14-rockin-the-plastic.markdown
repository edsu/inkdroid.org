<p>Yeah, the blog is back after getting routed by the LinuXploit Crew. The whole episode was really rewarding actually. I learned what projects I work on that need to be hosted elsewhere at more stable locations--that are likely to outlive my pathetic musings. I (re)learned how important good friends are (ksclarke, dchud, wtd, jaf, gabe, rsinger) in a pinch. And I watched in awe as the Wordpress 2.2 upgrade actually worked on my pathologically old  instance (which I suspect to have been the front door). Oh, and it was a good excuse to ditch gentoo for ubuntu.</p>
<p>Spring cleaning came a bit late this year I guess. Thanks LinuXploit Crew!</p>
