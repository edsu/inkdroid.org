  content: "Shortly hasn\\'t happened yet, although it looks like all Ross needs to
    do is register a project on rubyforge and upload the gem. I created a Rakefile
    for creating the gem. You can install from a local gem file in the meantime if
    you like:\r\n<pre>% svn co http://rsinger.library.gatech.edu/svn/openurl_registry/\r\n%
    cd openurl_registry\r\n% rake test\r\n% rake package\r\n% gem install pkg/resolver_resgistry-0.0.1.gem</pre>\r\noughta
    do it..."

<p>So <a href="http://dilettantes.code4lib.org/">Ross</a> beat out 11 other projects to <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/announcements/2006-09-28.htm">win</a> the OCLC Research Software Contest for his next generation OpenURL resolver <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070319172523/http://umlaut.library.gatech.edu:80/umlaut">umlaut</a>. Second place went to to Jesse Andrews' <a href="http://bookburro.org/">BookBurro</a>--so the competition was fierce this year. Much more so than last year when there were 4 contestants.</p>
<p>Those of us who hang out in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a> got to hear about this project when it was just a glimmer in his eye...and had front row seats for hearing about the development as it progressed. Essentially umlaut is an openurl router that's able to consult online catalogs (via SRU), other OpenURL resolvers (SFX), Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Connotea, CiteULike and OAI-PMH. It's all written in <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">RubyOnRails</a>.</p>
<p>I feel particularly proud because Ross is enough of a mad genius to have found a use for some ruby gems I wrote for doing <a href="http://www.textualize.com/sruby">sru</a>, <a href="http://www.textualize.com/ruby-oai">oai-pmh</a> and querying OCLC's <a href="http://www.textualize.com/xisbn">xisbn</a> service.</p>
<p>Speaking of which we've been collaborating recently on a little ruby gem for querying OCLC's <a href="http://www.oclc.org/productworks/urlresolver.htm">OpenURL Resolver Registry</a>. This registry essentially makes it easy to determine what the appropriate OpenURL resolver is given a particular IP address. So you could theoretically rewrite your fulltext URLs so that they were geospatially aware. For example:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
  require "resolver_registry"

  client = ResolverRegistry::Client.new
  institution = client.find('130.207.50.91')
  print institution.resolver.base_address
  </pre>
<p>If you want to take a look direct your svn client like so:</p>
<pre>
svn co http://rsinger.library.gatech.edu/svn/openurl_registry/
</pre>
<p>I imagine it'll get released to rubyforge sometime shortly.</p>
