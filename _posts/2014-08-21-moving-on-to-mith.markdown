<p>I'm very excited to say that I am going to be joining the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> to work as their Lead Developer. Apart from the super impressive <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/people/">folks</a> at MITH that I will be joining, I am really looking forward to helping them continue to explore how digital media can be used in interdisciplinary scholarship and learning...and to build and sustain tools that make and remake the work of digital humanities research. MITH's role in the digital humanities field, and its connections on campus and to institutions and projects around the world were just too good of an opportunity to pass up.</p>
<p>I'm extremely grateful to my colleagues at the Library of Congress who have made working over the last 8 years such a transformative experience. It's a bit of a cliche that there are challenges to working in the .gov space. But at the end of the day, I am so proud to have been part of the mission to "further the progress of knowledge and creativity for the benefit of the American people". It's a tall order, that took me in a few directions that ended up bearing fruit, and some others that didn't. But that's always the way of things right? Thanks to all of you (you know who you are) that made it so rewarding...and so much fun.</p>
<p>When I wrote recently about the importance of <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/2014/05/20/broken-world/">broken world thinking</a> I had no idea I would be leaving LC to join MITH in a few weeks. I feel incredibly lucky to be able to continue to work in the still evolving space of digital curation and preservation, with a renewed focus on putting data to use, and helping make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Oh, and I still plan on writing here ... so, till the next episode.</p>
