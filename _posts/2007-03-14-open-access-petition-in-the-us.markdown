  content: "[...] As others have noted, there is now an online petition in support
    of public access to publicly funded research in the United States. The text of
    the petition is short:  We, the undersigned, believe that broad dissemination
    of research results is fundamental to the advancement of knowledge. For Americaâ€™s
    taxpayers to obtain an optimal return on their investment in science, publicly
    funded research must be shared as broadly as possible. Yet too often, research
    results are not available to researchers, scientists, or the members of the public.
    Today, the Internet and digital technologies give us a powerful means of addressing
    this problem by removing access barriers and enabling new, expanded, and accelerated
    uses of research findings. [...]"

<p>As <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/archives/jisc-repositories.html">announced</a> on the jisc-repositories list there is now a <a href="http://www.publicaccesstoresearch.org/">US counterpart</a> to the <a href="http://www.ec-petition.eu/">EU Petition calling for Open Access</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>
We, the undersigned, believe that broad dissemination of research results is fundamental to the advancement of knowledge. For America&rsquo;s taxpayers to obtain an optimal return on their investment in science, publicly funded research must be shared as broadly as possible. Yet too often, research results are not available to researchers, scientists, or the members of the public. Today, the Internet and digital technologies give us a powerful means of addressing this problem by removing access barriers and enabling new, expanded, and accelerated uses of research findings.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The petition was put together by the <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/">Alliance for Taxpayer's Access</a> in response to the 28,000 odd enlightened folks who signed the EU petition. I was encouraged to see prominent sponsor icons for <a href="http://ala.org">American Libraries Association</a>, <a href="http://acrl.org">Association of College & Research Libraries</a> on the US petition.</p>
<p>I haven't been tracking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">Open Access</a> movement as well as I should have--but I did take a few seconds while drinking coffee at the breakfast table this morning to sign the petition. The movement seems to be really making a lot of progress recently. </p>
<p>Via a bit of synchronicity Caroline Arms sent a message around at $work about the recent <a href="http://www.delange.rice.edu/conferenceVI.cfm">Emerging Libraries</a> conference at Rice. Apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahle">Brewster Kahle</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg">Paul Ginsparg</a> had a meeting of like like minds. I guess it's not surprising considering their roles in bringing libraries and archives into the computing age with <a href="http://archive.org">The Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>. What is surprising is that it took this long. These two projects are wildly successful, living and breathing examples of Open Access projects. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://webcast.rice.edu/">audio</a> for all the conference presentations is available from Rice...including the very listenable <a href="http://webcast.rice.edu/index.php?action=details&event=927">Universal Access to Human Knowledge</a> (Kahle) and <a href="http://webcast.rice.edu/webcast.php?action=details&event=919">Read as We May</a> (Ginsparg).</p>
