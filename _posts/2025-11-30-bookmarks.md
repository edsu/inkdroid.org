    tinyfeed is a CLI tool that generate a static HTML page from a collection of feeds.

It's dead simple, no database, no config file, just a CLI and some HTML

Give it a list of RSS, Atom or JSON feeds urls and it will generate a single HTML page for it. Then you can effortlessly set it up in crond, systemd or openrc and voilà, you’ve got yourself a webpage that aggregates your favorite feeds.

      Crashing hard: why talking about bubbles obscures the real social cost of overinvesting into “Artificial Intelligence”
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    More and more commentators talk about and warn of an “AI bubble”, and everybody seems to congratulate each other on being such a smart financial analyst. BUT: A bubble pops and you are left with air and maybe a splash of soap somewhere on the floor. A fairly clean affair. This kind of investor speak obscures the severe consequences economic crashes cause, coming from someone’s point of view for whom this is more likely to be a spectacle than a direct threat...

In this article, I want to illustrate the broad range of costs that BOTH the buildup of “AI” overvaluations AND their coming down will have. The current “AI” investments will have long-term costs by creating significant path dependencies: They make harmful things cheaper, speed up the commodification of human labour and shift social norms.

  <section class="p-summary">
    A recent article in The Atlantic (“The Nonprofit Doing the AI Industry’s Dirty Work,” November 4, 2025) makes several false and misleading claims about the Common Crawl Foundation, including the accusation that our organization has “lied to publishers” about our activities.

This allegation is untrue. It misrepresents both how Common Crawl operates and the values that guide our work.

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Common Crawl doesn’t log in to the websites it scrapes, but its scraper is immune to some of the paywall mechanisms used by news publishers. For example, on many news websites, you can briefly see the full text of any article before your web browser executes the paywall code that checks whether you’re a subscriber and hides the content if you’re not. Common Crawl’s scraper never executes that code, so it gets the full articles. Thus, by my estimate, the foundation’s archives contain millions of articles from news organizations around the world, including The Economist, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Harper’s, and The Atlantic.

      The Matrix of Convivial Technology – Assessing technologies for degrowth
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    This article introduces the notion of convivial technology as a conceptual framework for technologies suitable for degrowth societies. This paper is inspired by Ivan Illich's notion of convivial tools but reconsiders it in the light of current practices and discussions. Looking for a definition of convivial technologies it uses qualitative empirical research conducted with degrowth-oriented groups developing or adapting grassroots technologies like Open Source cargo bikes or composting toilets in Germany. The basic ethical values and design criteria that guide these different groups in relation to technology are summed up into five dimensions: relatedness, adaptability, accessibility, bio-interaction and appropriateness. These dimensions can be correlated with the four life-cycle levels material, production, use and infrastructure to form the Matrix for Convivial Technology (MCT). The MCT is a 20-field schema that can be filled in. Experiences with the tool in different fields are presented. The MCT is itself a convivial tool as it allows for degrowth-oriented groups to self-assess their work and products in a qualitative, context-sensitive and independent way. It is a normative schema that fosters discussion concerning degrowth technologies in contexts of political education. And it is a research method as it helps collecting data about underlying ethical assumptions and aspirations of individuals and groups engaged in developing technology.

    We programmers are currently living through the devaluation of our craft, in a way and rate we never anticipated possible. A fate that designers, writers, translators, tailors or book-binders lived through before us. Not that their craft would die out, but it would be mutilated — condemned to the grueling task of cleaning up what the machines messed up. Unsurprisingly, some of us are not handling the new realities well.

      A Month of Chat-Oriented Programming
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    TL;DR: I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”. It’s hard to know exactly how well, but I (“we”) definitely produced far more than I would have been able to do unassisted, probably at higher quality, and with a fair number of pretty good tests (about 1500). Against my expectation going in, I have changed my mind. I now believe chat-oriented programming (“CHOP”) can work today, if your tolerance for pain is high enough

      Generative artificial intelligence–mediated confirmation bias in health information seeking
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications, such as ChatGPT, are transforming how individuals access health information, offering conversational and highly personalized interactions. While these technologies can enhance health literacy and decision-making, their capacity to generate deeply tailored—hypercustomized—responses risks amplifying confirmation bias by reinforcing pre-existing beliefs, obscuring medical consensus, and perpetuating misinformation, posing significant challenges to public health. This paper examines GenAI-mediated confirmation bias in health information seeking, driven by the interplay between GenAI's hypercustomization capabilities and users’ confirmatory tendencies. Drawing on parallels with traditional online information-seeking behaviors, we identify three key “pressure points” where biases might emerge: query phrasing, preference for belief-consistent content, and resistance to belief-inconsistent information. Using illustrative examples, we highlight the limitations of existing safeguards and argue that even minor variations in applications’ configuration (e.g., Custom GPT) can exacerbate these biases along those pressure points. Given the widespread adoption and fragmentation (e.g., OpenAI's GPT Store) of GenAI applications, their influence on health-seeking behaviors demands urgent attention. Since technical safeguards alone may be insufficient, we propose a set of interventions, including enhancing digital literacy, empowering users with critical engagement strategies, and implementing robust regulatory oversight. These recommendations aim to ensure the safe integration of GenAI into daily life, supporting informed decision-making and preserving the integrity of public understanding of health information.

    A new Digital Digging investigation, here is the first one, conducted with Belgian researcher Nicolas Deleur, has uncovered 110,000 ChatGPT conversations preserved via Archive.org's Wayback Machine. When users click "share" on a ChatGPT conversation, they think they're creating a temporary link for a friend or colleague. What they don't realize is they were also creating a permanent, searchable record of their thoughts, confessions, and sometimes illegal activities seen by Archive.org.

  <section class="p-summary">
    As libraries continue to rely on a growing constellation of open systems, standards, and services, questions of sustainability, governance, and trust are more pressing than ever. This session will explore what it means to build and maintain “trustworthy infrastructure” in a decentralized and sometimes fractured landscape. Through high-level discussion and examples drawn from the open source library ecosystem, we’ll consider how community-led development, transparent decision-making, and responsible stewardship can help ensure that open infrastructure continues to meet the evolving needs of libraries and the communities they serve. Participants will leave with a stronger understanding of the values and challenges underpinning open library systems, and how we might collaboratively shape a more resilient and equitable future.

      Complexity, Artificial Life, and Artificial Intelligence Open Access

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    The scientific fields of complexity, Artificial Life (ALife), and artificial intelligence (AI) share commonalities: historic, conceptual, methodological, and philosophical. Although their origins trace back to the 1940s birth of cybernetics, they were able to develop properly only as modern information technology became available. In this perspective, I offer a personal (and thus biased) account of the expectations and limitations of these fields, some of which have their roots in the limits of formal systems. I use interactions, self-organization, emergence, and balance to compare different aspects of complexity, ALife, and AI. Even when the trajectory of the article is influenced by my personal experience, the general questions posed (which outweigh the answers) will, I hope, be useful in aligning efforts in these fields toward overcoming—or accepting—their limits.

      Incorrect Citation Association for Articles in Online-Only Springer Nature Journals
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    We show that citation metrics of journal articles in many of the online-only Springer Nature journals and associated ones are distorted, going back to articles from 2001. We find that most likely due to an API response error, there are many incorrect references which typically lead to Article Number 1 of a given Volume. Among others, the issue affects journals such as Scientific Reports, Nature Communications, Communications journals, Cell Death & Disease, Light: Science & Applications, as well as many BMC, Discovery and npj journals. Beyond the negative effect of introducing incorrect reference information, this distorts the citation statistics of articles in these journals, with a few articles being massively over-cited compared to their peers, while many lose citations; e.g. both in Scientific Reports and in Nature Communications, 5 of the 10 top cited articles have article numbers of 1. We validate the distorted statistics by assessing data from multiple scientific literature databases: Crossref, OpenCitations, Semantic Scholar, and the journals' websites. The issue primarily arises from the inconsistent transition from page-based referencing of articles to article number-based referencing, as well as the improper handling of the change in the publisher's article metadata API. It seems that the most pressing problem has been present since approximately 2011, which we estimate affects the citation count of millions of authors.
