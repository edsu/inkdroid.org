<p>Here's a brief demo of what it looks like to use <a href="http://github.com/edsu/twarc">twarc</a> on the command line to archive tweets that are mentioning Ferguson. I've been doing archiving around this topic <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/2014/08/30/a-ferguson-twitter-archive/">off and on</a> since August of last year, and happened to start it up again recently to collect the response to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/us-calls-on-ferguson-to-overhaul-criminal-justice-system.html">Justice Department report</a>.</p>

<p>I kind of glossed over getting your Twitter keys set up, which is a bit tedious. I have them set in environment variables for that demo, but you can pass them in on the command line now. I guess that could be another demo sometime. If you are interested send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/edsu">tweet</a>.</p>
