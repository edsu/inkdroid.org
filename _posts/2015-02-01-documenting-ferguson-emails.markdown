<p>If you are an <a href="https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal">IfThisThenThat</a> user and are interested in archives maybe you'll be interested in <a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/252961-documenting-ferguson-emails">this recipe</a> that will email you when a new item is added to the <a href="http://digital.wustl.edu/ferguson/">Documenting Ferguson</a> repository. Let <a href="http://twitter.com/edsu">me</a> know if you give it a try! I just created the recipe and it hasn't emailed me yet. But the <a href="http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/items/browse?collection=62&amp;sort_field=added&amp;sort_dir=d&amp;output=rss2">RSS Feed</a> from Washington University's Omeka instance reports that the last item was added on January 30th, 2015. So the collection is still being added to.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/252961-documenting-ferguson-emails" target = "\_blank" class="embed\_recipe embed_recipe-l_27" id= "embed_recipe-252961"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/252961' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Documenting Ferguson Emails connects feed to email" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>
<p>I thought about having it tweet, but that would involve creating a Twitter account for the project and that isn't my place. Plus, RSS and Email are still fun Web 1.0 technologies that don't get enough love. Well I guess Email predates the Web entirely heh, but you get my drift.</p>
