Quoting @Macey:2019, quoting Foucault, quoting Nietzsche:

> One thing is needful. – To ‘give style’ to one’s character – a great and rare
> art! It is practised by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses that
> their nature has to offer and then fit them into an artistic plan until each
> appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye.
>
> @Nietzsche:2001, p. 290

This is a generous and lively image of what art does when it is working. Art is not perfection.
