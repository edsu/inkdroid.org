  content: "[...] authorities are not available as web resources is mind-boggling
    to me.  Oh wait, they are!  Ed Summers et. al. at the Library of Congress are
    at the forefront of this whole approach I am talking about. [...]"

<p>Adam Bosworth has some good advice for would-be standards developers in the form of a <a href="http://adambosworth.net/2009/10/29/talking-to-dc/">7 item list</a>. It is strangely reassuring to know that someone in the US Federal Government called someone like Adam for advice about standards...even if it was at some inhuman hour. Number 5 really resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Always have real implementations that are actually being used as part of [the] design of any standard ... And the real implementations should be supportable by a single engineer in a few weeks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is interesting because I think it could be argued that #1, #2, #4, #6 and #7 largely fall out from really doing #5.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the standard as simple and stupid as possible.</li>
<li>The data being exchanged should be human readable and easy to understand.</li>
<li>Standards should have precise encodings.</li>
<li>Put in hysteresis for the unexpected.</li>
<li>Make the spec itself free, public on the web, and include lots of simple examples on the web site.</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves #3 <em>Standards work best when they are focused</em> -- which seems to be a really tricky one to get right. Maybe it comes down to being able to say <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/the-power-of-no/">No</a> to the right things, to keep scope creep at bay. Or to be able to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stop It. Just Stop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>to ward off complexity, like Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html">Duct Tape Programmer</a>. But I think #3 is really about being able to say <em>Yes</em> to the right things. The right things are the things that bind together the most people involved in the effort. Maybe it's the "rough consensus" in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tao.html">Tao of the IETF</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in <em>rough consensus</em> and running code.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever it is, it seems slippery and subtle -- a zen-like appreciation for what is best in people, mixed with being in the right place at the right time.</p>
