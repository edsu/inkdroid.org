I've been slowly reading a collection of [Wisława Szymborska]'s poetry, ever since hearing some of her work read and discussed by other writers on the [New Yorker Poetry Podcast]. Today's was *Returning Birds*, which really spoke to me, maybe because it reads like a cipher for our times, in which instincts about the weather are increasingly a matter of life and death. But also, it seemed to me to be a celebration of a *particular* bird, it's anatomy a wonderful assemblage, an "earthbound protein" and "living kite", whose too short life is seen through the eyes of a rock, at the end. This idea of life being a "chain of failed attempts" from the perspective of inanimate nature, rings true, while also seeming to miss the point about all the beauty that is to be had in each and every attempt.

Instead of including the text here, I thought I'd read it:

If you want to read it, maybe, for a time, you can find the poem on p. 52 of [this PDF]. I'm not reading that collection, although it looks good. I picked up a copy of [Map].
