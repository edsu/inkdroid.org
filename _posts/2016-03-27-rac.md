For my Qualitative Research Methods class this week I was asked to find a 
research article in my field of interest that uses focus groups, and to 
write up a short summary of the article and critique their use of 
focus groups as a research method.

After what seemed like a bit too much searching around in Google Scholar I
eventually ran across an article written by Jon Newman of [Lambeth Archive] in
2012 about the experiences that a group of archives in the South East of England
had with participatory cataloging of their collections [@Newman:2012]. The
archives Newman discusses were all participants in the [Mandeville Legacy
Project] who were attempting to provide better access to their archival
collections related to the topic of disabilities and rehabilitation. They chose
to use a technique pioneered in the museum community called [Revisiting
Collections] which was adapted specifically for the archives as [Revisiting
Archive Collections] or RAC.

RAC is a technique that was designed by the [Collections Trust] in the UK to try
to make archival descriptions more inclusive, accurate and complete by including
the contributions of individuals outside of the archival profession. In the
words of the [RAC Toolkit]:

> A key strength of Revisiting Collections is that it provides a framework 
> for embedding new understanding and perspectives on objects and records 
> directly within the museum or archiveâ€™s collection knowledge management 
> system, ensuring that it forms part of the story about the collections 
> that is recorded and made accessible to all.

RAC's framework includes community based focus groups which bring
individuals into contact with archival materials and elicit knowledge sharing
as well as new narrative and documentation. RAC is similar in spirit to other
methods for achieving [participatory archives], but is different because it uses
actual focus groups rather than a Web based crowd sourcing approach. The 
framework includes [detailed instructions] for running a RAC focus group 
including:

* how to select participants
* how to select materials
* consent
* prompt questions
* data collection
* attribution
* room setup
* starting/ending the session
* follow up after the session

The essential idea is that people who have direct experience of the subject
material have much to offer in the description of the records. Newman connects
RAC's theoretical stance of involving more voices in the production of archives
with the work of Terry Cook, Tom Nesmith, Verne Harris, Wendy Duff and Eric
Ketelaar. This constellation of archival theory has been actively dismantling
the Jenkinsonian notion of the archivist as a neutral, informed, anonymous and
monolithic voice. It is not simply a stylistic choice, but a foundational point
about recognizing the archivist's and archive's role in shaping the historical
record. RAC is an example of connecting this theory to actual practice.

So Newman isn't using focus groups as a research method in this study, but is
instead reflecting on the use of focus groups as a technique for generating 
more complete and useful archival descriptions. To do this he provides
case studies that reflect the implementation of RAC in 5 county records offices.

He found that in all these cases work still needed to be done to integrate the 
results of the focus group sessions into the archival descriptions themselves. 
Part of the problem lay in how well the archival standards and systems
accommodate this new type of community or user centered information. Museums in
the UK (at least in 2012) have a [SPECTRUM] which is a standard that includes 
guidance for adding user generated information, and the standard is implemented
in museum collection management systems. Newman found that [guidance] on how 
RAC fit with archival description [ISAD(G)] systems was not enough to get the
newly acquired information into archival systems.

However Newman also found that the focus group sessions generated powerful,
revealing and creative descriptions of the records which were highly valuable.
The interactions between the archive and the external partners led to
increased levels of engagement and trust that was deemed extremely useful by
both parties. Using visual material from the archives was as an effective way 
to generate discussion in the focus groups.

Newman noted that some archivists had uncertainty about how to add the *emotive
content* of these contributions to the archival description. To my eye this
seemed like perhaps some were still clinging to the notion that archival
descriptions were unbiased and neutral. Indeed, I noticed that the RAC
guidelines themselves recommended only adding acquired content if it was deemed
neutral:

> Information that is destined for the ISAD(G) catalogue may be used 
> verbatim if you consider it to be neutral, factual and verifiable. 
> It is more likely, however, to be a trigger for the archivist to
> revisit the catalogue, investigate or authenticate the new information 
> that has been has been offered and rework the existing description. 
> (p. 24)

Of course revisiting the catalog to revise is a bit of a luxury, especially 
when many archives have large backlogs of records that lack any description 
at all.

The RAC guidelines also require attribution when adding to the official 
archival description. This in turn requires obtaining consent from the focus 
group participants. But Newman observed that there was occasionally some 
uncertainty about how this consent and attribution worked in situations 
like students names where privacy came into play.

A big part of the work of conducting the focus groups is in the data analysis
afterwards. RAC provides guidance on how to *mark up* the focus group
transcripts using 5 categories:

* ISAD(G) catalog
* keywords
* subject guide
* free text

As any researcher will tell you this markup process in itself can be highly time
consuming. I think it would've benefited Newman's article to examine how
participating archives were able to perform this step: how much they did it, and
what categories of information were most acquired. Some basic statistics such as
the number of focus groups conducted by institution, the number, ages,
backgrounds of participants, and time spent may have been difficult to acquire
but would've helped get more of a sense of the scope of the work. In addition it
would've been interesting to learn more about how focus group participants were
selected.

Despite these shortcomings I enjoyed Newman's analysis, and am sympathetic to
the theoretical goals of the RAC project. It is a useful example of putting
post-Foucauldian critiques of the archive into practice, without waving the
crowdsourcing magic wand.  I think a useful extension of this work would be to
dive a bit deeper into how participating archives routed around their archival
systems by adding content to websites and/or subject guides, and to contemplate
how archival description could be linked to that larger body of documentation.
