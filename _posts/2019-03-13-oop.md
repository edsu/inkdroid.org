I recently rewatched this 1997 Alan Kay talk about object-oriented programming
to prep for my class this week where we introduce OOP concepts.

It's really interesting to hear him talk about how the focus on *objects* in the name (which he coined) was a mistake.

For Kay (in 1997) OOP was about what lies in between, or
[Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_%28negative_space%29) (from Japanese) and
less about the objects themselves.

Teaching OOP is more like theorizing and critiquing a philosophy, or way of
thinking about the world, than it is about teaching a specific way of
programming.

This reminded me how much of an impact [Richard
Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel)'s work made on me as an
aspiring software developer.

Gabriel anticipated much of the software studies that was to come. I would lump
many of the [Object Oriented
Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology) folks in there
too, but it would be some work to connect those dots. For example Gabriel's
thesis advisor was [Terry
Winograd](https://inkdroid.org/2011/05/02/a-bit-about-scruffiness/), who [drew
on](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53482.Understanding_Computers_and_Cognition)
the same Heidegger that folks like
[Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Harman),
[Bogost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost) and
[Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton) have.  But the thing I
love about Gabriel's work, and the software studies work that really resonates
with me, is that OOP is also deeply about craft and practice--in short, art.

I like that Gabriel *permitted* himself to make things so that he could think
more clearly about how things were made. To people who make things regularly
this idea of giving yourself *permission* to make things (and perhaps even
remake things) may seem a bit weird. But for folks in academia, where the
premium is on the originality of your research, and concepts/ideas/theories
rather than things, I suspect it may seem more relevant.
