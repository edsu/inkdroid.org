Several years ago someone in our neighborhood was moving out of the area and
was giving away their old piano. We figured out a way to get it to our house,
and it has sat (still untuned) in a corner of our living room ever since.

The kids have sporadically taken piano lessons, and the various teachers who
have heard it have all been polite not to comment on its current state. Mostly
it just sits there, part table, part decoration, until someone stops by to play
a little tune.

It's interesting to hear the kids develop little signature riffs that they play
while walking by the piano in the morning, or sometimes before going to bed.
Here's a short untitled little tune that Maeve regularly plays, almost like
a little prayer, or memory:
