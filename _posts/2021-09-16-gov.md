In the lead up to the 2020 US Presidential Election Twitter [implemented] new
labels for government officials, organizations and state-affiliated media
accounts. This was a follow on from their previous ban on state-backed
political advertising in 2019.

By their own description Twitter apply these labels to:

* Accounts of key government officials, including foreign ministers,
  institutional entities, ambassadors, official spokespeople, and key
  diplomatic leaders. At this time, our focus is on senior officials and
  entities who are the official voice of the state abroad.
* Accounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities, their
  editors-in-chief, and/or their senior staff.

Here is an example of a government official (look for the label "United Kingdom
government official" just underneath their Twitter handle).

<a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson"><img src="/images/twitter-borisjohnson.png"></a>

More importantly the label takes up significant screen real estate in each of
that user's tweets:

<a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson"><img src="/images/twitter-borisjohnson-tweet.png"></a>

And here is a government organization:

<a href="https://twitter.com/KremlinRussia_E"><img src="/images/twitter-kremlinrussia_e.png"></a>

Known government run media organizations have labels too:

<a href="https://twitter.com/rt_com"><img src="/images/twitter-rt_com.png"></a>

But it's important to note that not all government run accounts will have the
labels. Here is the verified account for the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

<a href="https://twitter.com/PakPMO"><img src="/images/twitter-pakpmo.png"></a>

How the Prime Minister of Pakistan's office gets verified and not added to
a list of known government accounts is hard to imagine. It probably says
something about how difficult it is to uniformly apply these labels, and also
keep them up to date. It would take some research to find out, but it may also
say something about the political biases of the United States and Silicon
Valley. In case you were wondering, no the current Prime Minister of Pakistan
doesn't have a label either:

<a href="https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI"><img src="/images/twitter-imrankhanpti.png"></a>

Over in the [Documenting the Now Slack] we had some questions recently about
where to find these government labels in the data our tools collect. We took
a look and it doesn't appear that these labels are made available through
either the v1.1 or v2 API endpoints. *If this is wrong [please get in
touch](mailto:info@docnow.io)!*

Not making this information available is unfortunate because these labels are
highly significant pieces of metadata for researchers who are studying the
influence of government in social media conversations. They also provide
a window in on how Twitter themselves see the governments of the world through
their categorization rules and processes.

Since this information is only available through the web interface I recently
spent some time adding functionality to the [snscrape] utility to extract the
labels, as well as the label URLs. The label URLs are useful because, while
they aren't as specific as the label descriptions, they can sometimes be used
to group together different language variants of the same label.

This morning I tested it out by collecting 60,000 tweets that mention the word
"covid19".

    snscrape --jsonl twitter-search covid19 > results.jsonl

I then wrote a simple program to read the JSON and count the labels that were present:

| Label                        | tweets |
| ---------------------------- | ---:|
| China state-affiliated media | 173 |
| Iran state-affiliated media | 21 |
| Çin devletine bağlı medya | 9 |
| Медиј који сарађује са владом Србија | 9 |
| China government official | 8 |
| 中国官方媒体 | 7 |
| Thailand government organization | 7 |
| Russia state-affiliated media | 4 |
| Média affilié à un État, Russie | 4 |
| Média affilié à un État, Chine | 4 |
| Representante gubernamental de Cuba | 3 |
| Organisation du gouvernement - France | 2 |
| Organización gubernamental de España | 2 |
| Cuba - Funzionario di Stato | 2 |
| Medios afiliados al gobierno, China | 2 |
| Russia government account | 2 |
| Lembaga pemerintah Indonesia | 2 |
| Organización gubernamental de Cuba | 2 |
| Canada government official | 1 |
| Cina - Organizzazione governativa | 1 |
| Medios afiliados al gobierno, Honduras | 1 |
| Italia - Funzionario di Stato | 1 |

However for that same dataset of tweets there were only these three Label URLs used:

| URL | tweets |
| --- | ------:|
| https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/state-affiliated-china | 219 |
| https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/state-affiliated | 47 |
| https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/state-affiliated-iran | 22 |

So while the URLs don't provide anywhere near the level of granularity that the
descriptions do, they could be useful for grouping together language variants
of the same label like:

* China state-affiliated media 
* Média affilié à un État, Chine
* Medios afiliados al gobierno, China

Right now my modification to the [snscrape] tool is in a [pull request]. If you
think it might be useful in your own work please go and give it a thumbs up.
Normally I'm not a huge advocate of scraping social media. But when it comes to
data that is not available through sanctioned channels (APIs), and the data is
being created (and gatekeeped) by powerful entities we [aren't left with
much of a choice].

**Update 2021-09-20: the PR has been merged, so it's part of snscrape proper
now!**
