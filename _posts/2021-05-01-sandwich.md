Last night I noticed Darius Kazemi [post] about [a little web page] that
displays a random sandwich from a [list of Sandwiches] on Wikipedia. It tickled
me, probably because the page is so simple (view the source), and also because
the results were so delightfully varied, within such a narrow domain. Also,
I guess I was hungry...

It just so happens that for some things at work I've been thinking about
[Wikidata] a bit more recently. For the past year or so I've been lurking on
the mailing list and in various get togethers put on by the [LD4-Wikidata
Affinity Group]--who are doing some great work connecting Linked Data to the
actual work of libraries, museums and archives. I also attended a really
inspiring [event] from Rhizome this week about the relaunch of their [Artbase]
which uses [Wikibase], which is the open source software that powers Wikidata.
They are usually really good about putting their online events up on their
[Vimeo channel] so keep an eye out for it there if you are interested.

So, naturally, it seemed like a fun little Friday evening project to adapt
Darius' JavaScript to pull the sandwiches from Wikidata using their [query
service]. You can see the result [here].

[https://edsu.github.io/sandwich/](https://edsu.github.io/sandwich/)

My initial motivation was to see if the query service's [CORS] headers were
set up properly to allow HTTP traffic from the browser (they are) and to test
my ability to craft a good enough [SPARQL] query. But it also turned out to be
an interesting exercise in how to send people over to Wikidata to improve
things, since the descriptions of sandwiches in Wikidata are not as good as the
ones found in Wikipedia proper, and you can link directly to a page to edit
them in Wikidata.

Crafting the SPARQL query was quite a bit easier than I thought it would be
because they have a useful Examples tab, where I typed *sandwiches* and up came
the start of a query I could work with:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/sandwich-query.png">

There are currently 345 of these example queries and you can even add your own
by editing [this wiki page]. After a few minutes of noodling around I arrived
at this query:

```sparql
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?countryLabel ?image
WHERE
{
  ?item wdt:P279 wd:Q28803.
  ?item wdt:P495 ?country.
  ?item wdt:P18 ?image.
  SERVICE wikibase:label {bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en".}
}
LIMIT 1000
```

This wasn't my first dance with SPARQL, so I won't pretend this was easy. But
it's really nice to be able to be able to tweak the query examples and see what
happens. It seems obvious that a [query by example] query language would have,
well, examples. But Wikidata have done this in a very thoughtful way. It is
really nice to be able to query information like this live from the client, so
that users of your app can see the latest data that's available, not some
static snapshot of it.

But of course that comes with risks too, if the service is offline, if the
metadata structure changes, if the entity is defaced or deleted. None of
these things really matter for this toy page, but could for something more
solid. I've got a bit more to say about this, but I'm going to save it for
another post.
