<p>Via <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/">Ivan Herman</a> I found out about this 1 year old, <em>excellent</em> presentation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling">Hans Rosling</a> at the World Bank about the importance of sharing our data.</p>
<p>DbHd is certainly a problem. But it strikes me that, paradoxically, it's the love and care that people put into their datasets, that makes them so valuable to share. </p>
<p>If nobody was hugging their data, then nobody would care about setting it free on the Web.</p>
