In chapter 8 Nicolini brings attention to the study of discourse in practice
theory. Here's how he situates this movement to looking at discourse in relation
to the other practice theories that have been introduced so far:

> As we have seen in previous chapters, different theories of practice grant
> very different roles to language and discourse. For example,while Bourdieu
> almost ignores the role of linguistic matters (see my criticisms in Chapter
> 3), Schatzki describes practices as nexuses of‘sayings and doings’,warning
> that no priority should be granted to either of the terms (see Chapter 7).
> Thirdly, and most importantly, the study of discourse can offer some
> fundamental insights into the general understanding of practice. This is
> because, over the last five decades, a number of research programmes have
> developed the idea that discourse is,first and foremost, a form of action, a
> way of making things happen in the world, and not a mere way of representing
> it.From this perspective, language is seen as a discursive practice, a form of
> social and situated action. (p. 189)

He cites @Gee:2011 to distinguish lowercase *discourse* from uppercase
*Discourse*. *discourse* is taken as the mundane analysis of everyday language
in order to accomplish some activity. *Discourse* on the other hand is concerned
with the way linguistic and non-linguistic systems are integrated, and how this
can make notions of identity, knowledge and power legible. Nicolini treats this
more like a continuum with the local and the global at different poles. He takes
a look at three different approaches to discourse analysis, which are relevant
to practice theory.

### Conversation Analysis (CA)

CA grew out of ethno-methodology, but has established itself as a separate study
to some extent. It makes the following assumptions:

* all interaction is structurally organized (patterns, repetitions)
* sequencing of interactions is important (context, temporality)
* examination of audio/video recordings is extremely important in order to
  study interactions as they happened and in detail

It takes a very disciplined view of discourse and attempts to keep second order
theoretical considerations such as notions of power, politics, ideology at a
distance. There are some techniques or strategies such as the *turn-taking
machine* which provides a way of examining transcripts to look for patterns in
speech exchange.

### Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)

CDA was largely established by [Michel Foucault] whose approach to discourse
shifted from an archaeological approach to on focused on genealogy
[@Davidson:1986]. One feature of CDA is the idea of *discursive formations* or
sets of rules that determine what can and cannot be said as well a, what is
allowed and not allowed to be said. These formations are situated in relation to
other formats, which take as a whole form an *order of discourse*. Foucault's
view of discourse can be summarized as:

* discourse does reflect the state of affairs in the world as much as it does
  define and structure the actual state of affairs
* CDA is not limited to studying the mundane use of language, but takes into
  consideration all sorts of relations between discursive and non-discursive
  elements. 
* discourse necessarily involves the deployment of power and systems of
  domination
* the study of power and discourse must be studied from the bottom up, deriving
  the discursive formations from analysis at the local level, rather than using   using notions of established power structures.

Rather than looking at repetition as with a turn-taking-machine Foucault is
interested in looking at why and how practices establish and maintain
regularities across time and space. @Fairclough:2013 could provide a jumping off
point to learn more about the application of CDA. *Intertextuality* or the ways
in which texts are interconnected is an important concept in CDA. It focuses not
only on content and structure, but on the material chains and stabilized
networks along which texts move, or do not move along. He uses this diagram from
@Fairclough:1992, which might also be worth looking at:

  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/discourse.png">
</div>

This focus on the text or documents as they are situated in social practices 
seems like it could be a useful way of looking at the construction of web 
archives. I guess @Caswell:2016a could be a useful touchstone here if I continue
down this particular road. It also looks like Engeström, who I've encountered
[earlier] in Chapter 5, had some criticisms of the local/global dichotomy that
CDA sets up. I've been meaning to follow up on some of his work, so maybe his
connection to this idea of intertextuality is another vote to head in that 
direction.

### Mediated Discourse Analysis (MDA)

As he said previously, [Mediated Discourse Analysis] charts a middle path
between the linguistic focus of CA and the politically minded CDA by focusing on
practice and social action.  Nicolini cites @Scollon:2002 when outlining the 5
aspects to MDA, which draw heavily from practice theory:

* mediated action: mundane or micro actions
* mediational means: tools and other artifacts that amplify/constrain actions
* practice: actions with a history
* site of engagement: a place where the actions occur
* nexus of practice: relationships between practices

MDA was pioneered by [Ron Scollon] near the end of his life and, according to
Nicolini, much work remains in establishing it as a theory/model for actual
work. In particular Nicolini thinks MDA could be brought into conversation with
Actor Network Theory [@Latour:2005; @Law:2009]. Scollon worked at Georgetown
University, which makes me wonder if his papers are there. He was a linguist who
worked closely with his wife Suzanne Wong Scollon on intercultural communication
and discourse analysis.  It's interesting that he would end his career as a
linguist shifting attention to actions and practices in this way.
