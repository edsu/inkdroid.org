This [episode] of the [Frontiers in Commoning] is an interview with [Jack Kloppenburg] about the [Open Source Seed Initiative], which is building, or helping rebuild rather, a commons for sharing seeds. I think it contains some useful observations for open source software, and commoning more generally.

Humans have shared seeds for millennia. This sharing has been responsible for all the cultivars we know and love today around the world. Because of the nature of seed production, where one seed can beget hundreds more, there is a built in abundance model that historically made seed sharing a bad fit for mass-commodification. But this changed in 1980 when the US Supreme Court bowed to pressure from corporations and allowed life to be patented.

As a software developer, what interested me most was Kloppenburg's description of how the idea for OSSI took direct inspiration from the Open Source Software movement, specifically the [GNU GPL] and the idea of [CopyLeft] more generally. He describes how the software freedoms map onto seed sharing and use. But also, he talks about why the OSSI chose to use a [Pledge] rather than a License model.

> You have the freedom to use these OSSI-Pledged seeds in any way you choose. In return, you pledge not to restrict othersâ€™ use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents or other means, and to include this Pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives.

The OSSI chose to focus more on helping build a community of like minded seed producers and distributors, rather than on establishing a legal apparatus that would ðŸ¤ž protect seeds from capture by corporate interests. As Kloppenburg notes, relying on licenses means one must participate in a legal infrastructure that is de facto dominated by large corporations and their interests. A pledge is oriented around growing all the tangled, relational connections between the users of seeds. It's about strengthening, or reviving, an ancient and separate system of seed sharing. It's also about growing awareness and resistance to corporate practices, especially in the global south, as big agriculture tries to change the laws in other countries to suit their needs.

Of course, not having a license means that these openly pledged seeds could be "captured" by corporations. However, given their scale, large corporations actually control a small number of types of seeds that have use around the world. They are oriented around maximizing profit. Corporations aren't generally interested in the types of seeds that are being shared more openly in the OSSI, because these are more regionally specific. There is a local angle to these networks of sharing. He admits that corporate capture could happen if an innovation like a rust-proof crop were invented, but really that sort of innovation isn't what the OSSI is primarily interested in.

Instead the OSSI is interested in building community for:

1. Rediscovering native and indigenous forms of plants.
2. Sharing and preserving existing seeds.
3. Creating new cultivars that are of use.

Kloppenburg acknowledges that this approach to "openness" and "sharing" can be viewed skeptically by indigenous communities, who have been told similar things in the past, only to have their traditional practices taken without their permission for profit, where none of that profit is returned to them. Indeed, if you zoom out, colonialism and capitalism have been responsible for so much damage and destruction to indigenous ways of life -- and food sources have been a very significant part of that. So some seed producers have put modified versions of the OSSI Pledge in place. I'm reminded here Ostrom's idea that sustainable commoning doesn't necessarily mean that everything is open to everyone -- there are often clearly defined boundaries around commons, and that there are often practices for managing them [@Wall:2017b].

This naturally also reminded me about the challenges that [Open Access] has faced when working with indigenous communities, where intellectual property has been stolen and profited off of [@Christen:2012]. Frameworks for reciprocity that help build, strengthen and diversify networks of *reciprocal* relations are what is needed more than just openness [@Christen:2019; @Punzalan:2022]. It seems to me that OSSI's use of a Pledge rather than a legal tool like a License, provides another way forwards that honors the long and multi-threaded history of seed sharing.
