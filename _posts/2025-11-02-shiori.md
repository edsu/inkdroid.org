Back in January of this year I decided to leave [Pinboard], and start managing my bookmarks myself. I had been using the service for almost 15 years, so it was kind of a big change. The reasons for the move were that Pinboard had seemed increasingly unstable, and I discovered that the site owner had expressed some political views that didn't align very well with my own. Plus, I had wanted to see what other tools were like, especially open source options.

After experimenting with a few different tools I landed (for the time being) on running [Shiori] at home on a Raspberry Pi. I was able to import my historical bookmarks from Pinboard, and it has been working pretty well for me so far.

One thing I miss a little bit is being able to share what I'm reading publicly. So over the weekend I wrote a small [utility] that talks to the Shiori API and writes a summary of what I've been reading this week as a post here. Since this site is still running with Jekyll, it's a small bit of Ruby that runs from cron every Sunday evening. You can see an example of one of these [here].

If you have any thoughts about this please [let me know]!
