As I [previously mentioned] I'm taking a look at Practice Theory as part of my
coursework this semester. First up is reading [Davide Nicolini]'s [Practice
Theory, Work, and Organization]. This post is about chapter one, but I may cover
multiple chapters in subsequent posts.

Even though Nicolini is writing a book about Practice Theory he resists the
urge to try to establish a single, monolithic, unified practice theory, and has
structured his book around six separate strands: 

* social praxeology: [Bourdieu] and [Giddens]
* practice as tradition
* [Activity Theory]
* [Ethnomethodology]
* [Schatzki]'s work building on [Heidegger] and [Wittgenstein]
* critical discourse analysis

He cites @Schatzki:2001a when mentioning this emphasis on practice *theories*
rather than a unified practice theory. This same work is cited pretty heavily
elsewhere in the first chapter, and seeing that he dedicates a whole chapter to
him Schatzki is clearly important to Nicolini. If anyone is looking for a
Wikipedia page to write, there appears to be no article for Schatzki, despite
the fact that he is mentioned prominently in the article for [Practice Theory].
Maybe that can be something I can create a stub for when it comes to the chapter
on Schatzki...

Nicolini also distinguishes between weak and strong practice theory.  In weak
practice theory the techniques of paying attention to the mundane details of
activity are used in an effort to catalog and describe various practices in a
particular domain or context. Hard practice theory does this as well but goes an
extra step in trying to explain how the practices are generated in various
contexts over time. Strong practice theory takes identified practices as the
unit of analysis and build ontological analyses upon them.

It strikes me that in my own first tentative steps in using practice theory I've
definitely been more in the weak camp. I've applied an attention to mundane
details to identify practices, but haven't done much analysis of how those
practices are sustained over time--the ontological work. I'm hopeful that this
book will give me the tools to help me shift towards trying more of that. While
there is clearly an ordering to weak/strong I wonder if there may be hidden
humanistic benefits to a weak approach--where letting the reader infer
connections, rather than explicitly giving them could be useful. I can't help
but be reminded of [Hard] and [Soft] sci-fi.
