<p>I got an email from Thorsten Schwander at <a href="http://lanl.gov">LANL</a> about a bug in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/OAI-Harvester">Net::OAI::Harvester</a> when using a custom metadata handler with the auto-resumption token handling code. This was the first I'd heard about anyone using the custom metadata handling feature in N:O:H, so I was pleased to hear about it. Thorsten was kind enough to send a patch, so a new version is on its way around the CPAN mirrors. While it's hardly a major change, this is bumping the version from 0.991 to 1.0. It's been over 2 years since N:O:H was first released, and it's been pretty stable for the past year. </p>
