This post contains some rough notes for [Andrew Russell]'s [Open Standards in
the Digital Age] which I just finished reading. If you are interested in the
broad historical arc of standards development, particularly as they relate to
the history of the Internet and telecommunications in the United States, then
this is the book for you.  In trying to keep with the spirit of Paul Edward's
[reading advice] these notes aren't really meant to convey the full picture of
Open Standards, but just focus on the somewhat selfish task of reminding myself
why I read it, what my personal stakes were in the book, and what I got out of
it.

I wanted to read Open Standards because I've been thinking that researching web
archiving practices will also require understanding the standards that make it
possible. In addition to his findings about the development of the Internet, I
was also curious about what theories, methods and sources Russell used in his
attempt to investigate standards as "recipes for reality" (p. 16).

Russell is a [Science and Technologies Studies] (STS) scholar, who in addition
to starting the STS program at Stevens Institute for Technology, also helped
start [The Maintainers] conference, which I've wanted to attend the past couple
of years, and couldn't for a variety of reasons. My interest in repair, in
particular how it relates to digital preservation, was sparked a few years ago
by encountering @Jackson:2014. After hearing Jackson speak at UMD, and more
reading I've dug into since then, I've come to see the connections between
repair, maintenance and infrastructure studies as one strand in a tradition of
STS work. STS is a very interdisciplinary field that (I think) fits well in an
iSchool environment, as well as the field of digital humanities, because of its
study of technology using historical and ethnographic methods. 

*Aside: Digital humanities often gets articulated as the use of digital tools in
humanities research. But I think it's fair to say that DH also includes the
study of information technologies using theories and methods from the
humanities. I'm hoping that this is not a radical claim so I connect my interest
in information studies and digital humanities.*

*Open Standards* is centered around two concepts. The first is that our
technologies are shaped by our politics, and that in turn our technologies shape
our politics. So technologies are embodiments and expressions of ideology. This
theme draws on research on the politics and social construction of technologies
[@Winner:1980 ; @Hughes:1987], which are in the news a lot today as we grapple
with the effects of algorithm and big data on society. While Russell doesn't
come out and say it, I think both of these ideas connect with theories of
[coproduction] [@Jasanoff:2006] and Actor-Network-Theory [@Law:2013], which
treats the human and material as equal actors.

The second core idea in Open Standards is the role of *critique* in the study of
technology, and standards specifically. On the one hand, critique is used as a
way of furthering what @Foucault:1997 describes as an instrument of resistance,
and a challenge to the status quo. By the end of the book Russell has positioned
standards themselves as critiques:

> I have argued that we should understand these hybrid organizations -- and
> the standards they create -- as value-laden expressions of ideology, or 
> ideas about how society should be ordered and how power should be exercised.
> I also have argued that innovation in network standards is a form of critique;
> these innovations do not merely challenge what is, they take productive 
> action and make what could be. In this way, *Open Standards and the Digital 
> Age* is an attempt to bring themes from business, economic and organizational
> history into closer conversation with constructivist histories of science and
> technology. In the process, we can bring a richer historical perspective to
> the question of how control persists in the midst of decentralization.

This approach reflects Russell's interest in using critique not just as a means
for deconstruction, but also as a means for creation, invention and taking
things apart in order to remake the world [@Raunig:2008]. Both of these themes
strongly recall Jackson's use of the word repair, and breakdown as a site for
design and innovation.

According to Russell there are three types of standards: *de facto* (market
driven), *de jure* (legally enforced) and *voluntary consensus*.  Russell's
contribution here is in distinguishing this third type of standard achieved
through the process of voluntary consensus, which is a kind of middle ground
between standards that are developed in the marketplace, and standards that are
enforced by law. Russell's interest in this middle category is what allows him
to provide a much richer historical description of the processes that give rise
to standards. Otherwise the story would have reduced to either an economic or
political analysis, that would miss out on the distinctive stories present in
the book.

Standardization in the US in the 19th century happened largely in committees as
part of organizations like American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME),
American Institute for Electrical Engineers (AIEE), American Society for Testing
Materials (ASTM). These efforts were largely driven by attempts to improve
efficiency and reliability. These organizations welcomed participation from all
types of interested parties, who were typically engineers and managers from
businesses that were directly effected by the standards. The associations had
rules to try to ensure one party didn’t exert too much control. These standards
committees were linked directly to the professions that hosted them.  [Herbert
Hoover], himself a successful businessman and philanthropist, mobilized the idea
of efficiency, and standardization in associations as a way to achieve it. Paul
Gough Agnew of the American Engineering Standards Committee was also a
significant figure who had a role in the formation of ISO after WW2 who pointed
out that:

> ... the human difficulties are usually much more serious than the 
> technical ones. (p. 68)

Which is saying things lightly. The American Standards Association developed
processes to encourage standardization without requiring centralized
intervention by the federal government. However Hoover as President certainly
was endorsing these standards development organizations. De facto stanards in
the United States were being jointly approved of at the national scale as a
technique for opening markets.

AT&T’s standardization processes were mammoth.

The abbreviated form of the [Bell System Practices] as "The Practice" is a
literal indicator that standards are in fact coded instructions, for
understanding practices. As 

Despite AT&T’s monopoly [Bancroft Gherardi Jr.] emerges as a very likeable
figure because of his role shaping the engineering efforts of AT&T over a period
of rapid growth, and also for his role developing standards at the AIEE, ASME
and ASA.  Participation in these bodies allowed AT&T to not only reinforce its
own position in the marketplace, but also to keep up with innovations happening
elsewhere in the industry. The use of standards allowed them to take an
incremental approach to innovation, rather than one of radical disruption. This
incrementalism allowed for improving the services and infrastructure while also
maintaining it, and reminds me a bit of the early development of the web.
Engineers at AT&T applied lessons learned during the development of railroads
and the telegraph, using standards to control network effects. In some ways they
were too successful, which led to being regulated by the DoJ and FCC. 

The FCC itself was born of a mistrust of business oversight having led to the
Great Depression. Interest in decentralization was further fueled by interest in
developing electronics and using market competition to drive it. 

[ARPANET] was developed by the Defense Dept during the Cold War using packet
switching which was theorized by [Paul Baran] at RAND and [Donald Davies] at
National Physics Laboratory in England. AT&T had nothing to do with the effort —
it just ran over their lines. Defense Dept funded graduate student researchers
at Universities who met as the Network Working Group (NWG). The NWG was a closed
network, very unlike the standards bodies that existed at the time. NWG
initiated the RFC series since no other standards body would do. They were
informal documents because they thought the real designers would arrive
sometime, says Steve Crocker at UCLA:

> Most of us were graduate students … we kept expecting that an 
> official protocol design team would announce itself. (p. 169)

Discussion of ARPANET was opened up in 1972 at the First International
Conference of Computer Communications in DC. This meeting brought ARPANET people
into conversation with others working on different approaches to packet switched
networks being done in the UK and France ([Cyclades]) went to form the
International Network Working Group (INWG) led by then UCLA grad student Vint
Cerf. Cerf and Robert Kahn were able to seed lots of research money from ARPA to
work on new ways of delivering packets between different types of networks
(inter-networking). Kuo at NWG issued a recommendation that the various large
standards bodies not issue a standard, because more experimentation was needed.
But there was too much interest and companies and standards organizations
couldn’t resist.

A significant debate was between virtual circuit and datagram based protocols.
Both were packet switching based but in the former the network made sure all the
packets were delivered, whereas in that latter only the endpoints (the sender
and receiver) kept track of that. Datagrams came from [Louis Pouzin] at the
Cyclades project. The virtual circuit approach simulated a connection, but
datagrams were connectionless. Virtual circuits were more like the old
telephonic technologies.  With datagrams the network didn’t care what the data
was, only the edges did. This became known as the [End-to-End-Principle]. Pouzin
comes across as a very likeable character in this story because of his
understanding of these standards as critiques of the political and economic
order, that (for computer networks) is largely defined by IBM.

An early standard for computer networks developed by the telecommunications
industry. The [X.25] standard was desirable to the telephone corporations
because it was circuit based. Roberts (first director of IPTO at DARPA and
“Father of ARPANET”) was trying to start a company and tried to rush X.25
through when he was presiding over the group that drafted X.25. Pouzin opposed
X.25 for technical as well as political/economic reasons, which was unusual
[@Pouzin:1976].

Failure to get datagrams into X.25 and TCP into INWG 96 led Cerf to leave
Stanford and go to direct the Internet Program at IPTO with Kahn.

INWG 96 basically went nowhere because of the corporate and governmental forces
that were arrayed against it. Pouzin was vocal about the adverse effect that the
telecommunications industry was having on the standardization process, and his
Cyclades project was punished by the French government. But still Cerf called
him the "[datagram guru]". Telecommunications industry pushing X.25 and attempts
to standardize [Open Systems Integration] (OSI) at the ISO failed because of
industry and national pressures. In an interesting aside [Charles Bachman] of
Honeywell talks about the ISO’s approval of OSI reference model in 1982:

> I would say that 75% was based on my work at Honeywell. It was 
> well documented. We worked, as you sometimes have to do, to cover 
> the traces. (p. 213)

In doing historical work around standards it becomes important to understand
what these traces were, and why they were important to efface. The citation
structure of *Open Standards* shows Russell transitions from citing archival
material to citing content that is [on the web]. It really is striking how much
of the history of the Internet is in emails on the Internet. This detail reminds
me of [Kelty:2008]'s insight of a recursive public, where the technology of the
Internet is used to create the Internet.

One of Russell's most compelling findings that *Open Standards* makes is that 
the Internet's ideology of openness obscures its autocratic origins:

> The Internet, like many many technological novelties that preceded it, 
> provokes fantasies that its history does not support. Its origins were
> autocratic, not democratic. Its design and standardization indicates the
> central importance of organizational boundaries and the alliances that 
> mobilize across them; it does not portend the death of organizational
> gatekeepers or of organizations altogether. (p. 263)

It is useful to look at the development of the Internet as part of the larger
historical arc of standardization, that is focused on looking at the
organizations that are putting standards into motion. Russell credits
@Galambos:2012 with this idea of using the history of organizational change to
look at technology. Galambos was on his PhD dissertation committee, so there is
an intellectual lineage there to look at. Above all Russell's method of
attending to the standards and the words people use to illuminate the practices
and discourse of Internet engineering could serve as a good method for my own
work.

In some ways *Open Standards* connects James Scott's [Seeing Like a State] which
has greatly influenced my own thinking. In the United States there is not only
the state that is seeing, but also a complex assemblage of organizations and
infrastructure that are working to make certain things legible. How do Scott's
ideas of resistance to these modes of seeing play into this? Thinking of Scott
also highlights one of the potential blind spots of Russell's analysis. Much of
the book rests on a foundation of [American exceptionalism], where consensus
based standards were developed because of an American fear of centralized
control. Organizations needed ways of creating efficiencies in the marketplace
without resorting to de jure standardization, as much of Europe was doing.
However the development of de facto standards, and the history of practice can
be traced back further than American distrust of authority. These are histories
of practice that have a longer arc that would be useful to at least gesture at
[@Sennett:2008]. But perhaps it would undermine the historical tale that is
being told here.

Despite arguments that the Internet’s development was the result of open
standards processes, OSI’s failure was largely attributed to its openness. The
development model of TCP/IP rejected membership and voting. Others such as
@Turner:2006 have linked this skepticism to counterculture of the 60s. However
the convergence of telephony and computer technologies (ICTs) gave rise to a
recognition that national if not global standards were required. The criticisms
of OSI mobilized by TCP/IP camp were largely expressed as problems related to
"anticipated standardization", instead of codifying existing practice. Kahn and
Cerf pursued a different (and older) approach to OSI, where implementation
preceded standardization. The whole OSI vs TCP/IP story is very reminiscent in a
way of the Semantic Web vs REST visions of the Web...which itself is a story of
standardization and openness.

There's lots to chew on in this book, but at the end of the day the main thing I
can bring into my own work is the ideas of standards as critiques, as documents
that organize and challenge the status quo in particular ways. Being able to
articulate how the standards are operating and who they are operating on is a
key element to understanding their historical context.
