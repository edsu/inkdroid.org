I spent a few hours today using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine [CDX API] in a [notebook] to see how many snapshots of the Los Angeles Police Department website they've made (1,120,030), and specifically how many unique PDF documents there are in there (10,437).

It's really quite beautiful how you can easily use the [wayback] module to drop the results of searching the API directly into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis:

```python
import pandas
import wayback

wb = wayback.WaybackClient()
lapd = pandas.DataFrame(wb.search('lapdonline.org', scopeType='prefix')
```

I did run into some inconsistencies between searching using a *scopeType=domain* versus *scopeType=prefix*.

It's my understanding that using *domain* allows you to fetch the complete results for any subdomain of that domain, so `assets.lapdonline.org` in addition to `www.lapdonline.org` when searching for `lapdonline.org`.

But that didn't seem to be the case (see this [example]). So I used *scopeType=domain* to discover the relevant hostnames and then looked for each individually with a *scopeType=prefix* query.

```python
```
