A friend of the family asked for a map of how I used to commute from my neighborhood to UMD by bike. Here's the map I created, with a few annotations.

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed my commute along side Sligo Creek, especially after a day at work to clear my head.

I've been helping my friend Ernesto Calvo off and on for years with some data collection work, and partly in compensation he recently set me up with affiliate status in his department. This means I have a desk to use there, and can resume my bik commutes.

I'm working remotely with Stanford University, but don't have a ton of space at home (especially during the summer) so this is super helpful.
