  content: "It's ancient history now, but the empty Freebase search results most of
    have been due to an error during the search because Freebase knows about many
    different Braeburns and has for some time.\r\n\r\nAs for reporting problems like
    this, if you click the Feedback/More Info link under the bottom right corner of
    the card, it'll offer to let you mark various facts (including the image) as being
    wrong.  You can see it in your screen caps.\r\n\r\n@tfmorris"

<p>It has been observed that when systems break down we get to actually see how they operate. I wonder what this breakage below says about the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/19/google-search-knowledge-graph-singhal-interview">use</a> of Freebase and Wikipedia data in Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">Knowlege Graph</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=braeburn&fp=82bae2c3ce10781c"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://inkdroid.org/images/braeburn-kg.png"/></a></p>
<p>Yes, that's an image of <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Braeburn">Braeburn</a> from My Little Pony to the right, and text about the apple to the left. Interestingly it's fine at Wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braeburn"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://inkdroid.org/images/braeburn-wp.png"/></a></p>
<p>And it's not even there in Freebase (according to a search).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freebase.com/search?limit=30&start=0&query=braeburn"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://inkdroid.org/images/braeburn-fb.png"/></a></p>
<p>I don't know if this reveals what's going on in the flow of entities between Wikipedia, Freebase and Google. But I thought it was interesting. I wonder where to report such an anomaly. Is there a place?</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/107581973435023382062/posts">Jeff Godin</a> in <a href="irc:irc.feenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a> for noticing the breakage in Knowledge Graph.</p>
<p>See also Hilary Mason's <a href="http://www.hilarymason.com/blog/im-a-dead-celebrity/">post</a> about how her identity got mixed up on Bing. (Thanks <a href="http://improbable.org/chris">Chris</a>).</p>
<p>Update: 2012-02-04</p>
<p>I thought to check a week later, and the The Knowledge Graph results got even funnier, now it's a collage of apples and My Little Pony:</p>
