From the end of Jeff Vandermeer's gem of a book [Annihilation](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/book/annihilation/):

> I am aware that all of this speculation is incomplete, inexact, inaccurate, useless. If I don't have real answers, it is because we still don't know what questions to ask. Our instruments are useless, our methodology broken, our motivations selfish. (192-193)

I happened to read this book quickly (it's short) not long after listening to [this podcast interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyBosLx7bbM) with [Nathalie Cabrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathalie_Cabrol) about SETI and the search for alien life.

Despite some awkward turns from the interviewer I was really struck by Cabrol's goal of trying to understand the universe by deepening our knowledge and *experience* of the Earth, and life on Earth. To endeavour to ask better questions, and deepen our listening about what is around us, and our connection to it. The paradox of searching for something that we really are unable to define.

I guess it was just proximity, but Vandermeer's story seemed like a meditation on this theme -- and the role that representation and love plays in our understanding. What a book to end the year with!
