From [Jerome Rothenberg]'s Pre-Faces and Other Writings:

> A Personal Manifesto (1966)
>
> 1) I will change your mind;
> 2) any means (= methods) to that end;
> 3) to oppose the "devourers" = bureaucrats, system-makers, priests, etc. (W. Blake);
> 4) "& if thou wdst understand that wch is me, know this: all that I have sd I have uttered playfully---& I was by no means ashamed of it." (J. C. to disciples, *The Acts of St. John*)

When I bought the book at [Dog Eared Books] in a visit to SF the bookseller told me he had a class with Rothenberg at UCSD, which he enjoyed because Rothenberg would bring in exotic musical instruments and play joyfully for the class, as part of his lectures. There are lots of [fun recordings] of Rothenberg over at Penn Sound.
