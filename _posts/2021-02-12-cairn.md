Here is a short recording and a couple photos from my morning walk along
the Northwest Branch trail with Penny. I can't go every day but at 7 months
old she has tons of energy, so it's generally a good idea for all concerned
to go at least every other morning. And it's a good thing, because the walk
is surprisingly peaceful, and it's such a joy to see her run through the
woods.

After walking about 30 minutes there is this little [cairn] that is
a reminder for me to turn around. After seeing it grow in size I was sad to
see it knocked down one day. But, ever so slowly, it is getting built back
up again.
