<p>Well, I took the plunge and installed the latest version of OS X. I'm actually posting this blog entry with a WordPress dashboard <a href="http://www.firewire.org/downloads/dashboard/blogs_forums/wordpressdash.html">plugin</a>. I backed up my mail, addressbook and calendar and did a clean install. I was a bit nervous that I forgot to back up everything I needed...but it was also kind of refreshing starting with a clean slate.  I've got the latest versions of Perl and Python building in the background now, and everything so far seems pretty smooth. I hope to take a closer look at dashboard widgets sometime soon.</p>
