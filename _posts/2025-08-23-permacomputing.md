I enjoyed listening to this talk by [Devine Lu Linvega] about the nomad life and the principles of [Permacomputing] while I was on a walk, and then watching it later when I was at home for the visuals.

One of the things that I found myself thinking about when listening was the somewhat unstated principle of [Practice](https://inkdroid.org/tag/practice/), which 100 Rabbits work exemplifies so well. Watching the video afterwards then drove this point home, because of the artistry that went into the slides. There are certainly technical aspects to sustainable computing, but culture, shared values, and techniques are just, or perhaps even more, important.

I think a written version of the talk will get published over at [100r.co](https://100r.co/site/log.html) at some point but I wanted to jot down some of my own notes.

Permacomputing practice includes work along a continuum, where each step is further away from a resource rich environment:

* Frugal (being careful about the resources that you use)
* Salvage (limited to what is already produced)
* Collapse (utilizing what has survived collapse of infrastructure).

There is a technological bent to a lot of permacomputing practice (computing is in the name after all). But there is no need for it to be exclusively related to tech. It involves an engagement with community, and is fundamentally about "exploring the value of absence". Finding where technologies don't have a strengthening effect on the ecosystem. 

Devine sees three aspects of permacomputing design:

* Design for Disassembly: encourages repair by allowing a product to be taken apart and for users to discover how to repair it.
* Design for Encapsulation: be able to replicate the environment of a product: code and data can be migrated and/or emulated. Docker, JVM, [UXN], as examples of this thinking.
* Design for Descent: designing for degradation, failures of internet, energy, etc (resilience).

Resilience itself is a deep area of practice that includes:
- agility
- preparedness
- elasticity
- redundancy

Devine notes that permacomputing sort of fits within a longer trajectory of digital preservation work, and mentions some previous projects: PADI, Cedar, CAMiLEON, Domesday Project. These projects were well funded, did good work, but are now largely defunct, with only some scraps of information remaining in the Wayback Machine.

This reminded me of my own experience with digital preservation grant funding, and how paradoxically it is at odds with the goals of sustainability and preservation. Even when granting organizations require a plan for a sustainability plan, the types of activities and practices that are born into a resource rich environment can be difficult to sustain, unless they participate in some way with resource extraction. The discipline of doing work on a boat, as a nomad, (or some equivalent frugality) helps to shape sustainable computing practice.

Another aspect is the importance of piracy to digital preservation or that:

> Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from Preservation.

This reminded me of Abigail De Kosnik's book [Rogue Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4087/Rogue-ArchivesDigital-Cultural-Memory-and-Media). I think the in built community, frugality, and decentralization of a sharing economy is often overlooked as a key to digital preservation and its something that permacomputing really stresses.

There is also the idea of aligning engineering with primitives from the natural world, e.g. the mathematics behind the [Arecibo Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) which were designed to translate across species and planetary ecosystems. Whether it achieved that or not is hard to say, but the goal of reaching for computational primitives that could be rediscovered is an interesting angle. I think it's very important for data preservation standards. I feel like this sort of minimalist thinking lay behind the design of [BagIt], which aimed to allow data to be moved through time and space, without the loss of data and context.

Ultimately permacomputing is about "exploring the boundaries *between* suffocating minimalism and unsustainable maximalism". It's an invitation to slow down, and participate and learn to control the tools so they don't control us. Where does your work sit along that continuum?
