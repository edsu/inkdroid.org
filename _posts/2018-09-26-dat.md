Just a quick note that this site is now on the distributed web using [dat]. If
you have [Beaker Browser] or the [dat client] you can find it here:

    dat://inkdroid.org

[Tara Vancil] has an excellent post about how she publishes her [Hugo] static
site with dat. The basics work for me on my Jekyll site, but I thought I'd offer
a few small notes for Jekyll.

The basic process is to take your `_site` directory and turn it into a dat. As
Tara says you can simply:

1. `cd _site`
2. create your dat with `dat create`
3. enter a name and description for your dat
4. share your dat with the world with `dat share`

At this point if you share the dat URL that was minted for your dat, e.g. 

    dat://86f7fa89e4080532c805a6cc01f19ac3a4b4a6af676d81f40a67540a31e53e66

they should be able to open it Beaker, or download it with:

    dat dat://86f7fa89e4080532c805a6cc01f19ac3a4b4a6af676d81f40a67540a31e53e66

But at least with Jekyll the next time you regenerate `_site` your dat will get
deleted, so copy the `dat.json` metadata file that was created to your Jekyll
source tree:

    cp _site/dat.json dat.json
    git add dat.json
    git commit -m 'my dat file!' dat.json

Also you'll want to tell Jekyll to ignore your `_site/.dat` directory which is
where the dat repository lives, with the all important keys that identify you as
the owner of that dat URL. I added this stanza to my Jekyll `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
keep_files:
  - .dat
```

The only other wrinkle is deciding how much you want to keep your dat online. If
there are no peers running when someone fetches your site, then it will timeout.
Adjusting expectations around how available content is seems to be part of the
interesting intervention that dat is making. Perhaps we shouldn't expect our
content to be available at any time, especially when we aren't big companies
with deep pockets, and extractive business plans? Part of what makes dat fun at
this stage is that it's a bunch of developers, artists, designers and activists
who are trying to create a new kind of web, that's not about bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies.

So you can choose to keep a process running on your laptop, to share the dat
site. You can even use Beaker to share the entire site while you are using it.

As Tara outlines you can choose to serve your static site over http and dat
using [dathttpd]. In my case I have been happy running Apache for some time now,
so I set up [hypercored] instead, which you can configure to seed any number of
dats.

There final thing that Tara mentioned was how you can map your domain name to
your dat, which allows you to use a URL like dat://inkdroid.org instead of the
long complicated one. This is a breeze if you already have a website, you can
just add a text file at the root of your website /.well-known/dat and put your
dat URL in there, with a time-to-live.

When trying to resolve a host name Beaker looks for that well known file, and if
it finds something there it fetches that dat. There is a [DNS option] too which
is quite simple, and works for when your site isn't on the web. The pragmatic
approach that Beaker has taken to DNS is something I really like about the dat
ecosystem.
