<p>After 7 years of consultation Lockheed-Martin has been <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100601162705/http://archives.gov/era/acquisition/option-award.html">selected</a> to build the Electronic Records Archives for the National Archives and Records Administration for 38 million dollars.</p>
<blockquote><p>
ERA will provide NARA with the capability to authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of electronic record free from dependence on any specific hardware or software.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some aging exploratory papers on the NARA site, along with what appears to be a copy of the RFP...but I can't seem to find any specific information on how Lockheed Martin is planning to do this. I wonder what sort of track record L-M has in building electronic archiving software. Do they have an existing system which they are going to modify for NARA, or are they going to be building a new system from scratch?  It sure would be interesting to hear some more details.</p>
