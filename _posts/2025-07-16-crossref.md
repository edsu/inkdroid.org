I recently spent some time looking up DOIs in the [Crossref API] at work. Here a few takeaways in case you ever need to do it too:

- it looks like the most you can look up at a time is 49 using the https://api.crossref.org/works/?filter=doi1,doi2,... endpoint.
- responses take on average 8.08 seconds to return (std dev 5.97)
- if any of your DOIs fail to match this regex the entire request will fail with a HTTP 400 error `r"^doi:10\.(\d+)/.+$"`
- the server can return spurious HTTP 500 errors, which when retried succeed just fine

Your mileage will vary, as these are just observations from a point in time, and the state of the service is guaranteed to change over time.
