I recently spent some time looking up metadata for DOIs in the [Crossref API] at work. Here a few takeaways in case you ever need to do it too:

- it looks like the most you can look up at a time is 49 using the `https://api.crossref.org/works/?filter=doi1,doi2,...` endpoint.
- when looking up 40 at a time the responses take on average 8.08 seconds to return (std dev 5.97)
- if any of your DOIs fail to match this regex the entire request will fail with a HTTP 400 error `r"^doi:10\.\d{4,})/.+$"`
- the server can return spurious HTTP 500 errors, which when retried succeed just fine
- apparently you can do up to [50 requests per second] to the API?! I only did one at a time, and put a one second sleep in between since I wasn't in a particular rush, and wanted to look up 500,000 DOIs without pissing anyone off.

Your mileage will vary, as these are just observations at a point in time, and the state of the service is guaranteed to change over time.

Of course you could choose to bypass the REST API altogether and work with the [bulk download]. But in the situation we have at work we want to be able to update our data on a weekly basis, so the API makes more sense.
