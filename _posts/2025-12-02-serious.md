There was a bit of a tussle about Ruby recently, which seemed to center on whether it was a "serious" programming language:

* [Ruby Is Not a Serious Programming Language](https://www.wired.com/story/ruby-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/) 
* [Why So Serious?](https://robbyonrails.com/articles/2025/12/01/why-so-serious/)

In tone these two pieces reminded me a bit of the discourse around "[real programmers]", which is somewhat amusing on the one hand, but ultimately a conversational dead-end. However, in substance I don't think either position makes much sense.

I've seen disciplined teams do *serious* engineering with Ruby. Comprehensive test suites can provide some of the assurances that type safety provides.

Sure, software development can be fun and joyful. It should be joyful and rewarding when we are learning--and learning is a lifelong process.

But software is deeply intertwined with our lives. Being thoughtful, and even [frugal], about how we develop software isn't serious, it's *responsible*, and there's a difference. Saying that big corporations can deploy Ruby because they are burning cash isn't a convincing argument to choose Ruby today.

Would I choose Ruby today for a new project? It would all depend on what the project is. Is it a small utility to make my life easier? Absolutely. Is it a heavily used compute intensive service that other people need to rely on? Probably not. It matters more what we are [doing] with the software that is created. Being joyful *and* serious about that is possible, right?
