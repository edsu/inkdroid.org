    Your Second Brain has little somatic metadata. It's disembodied text floating in a void, stripped of the rich contextual markers that would actually help you remember and use it. When you try to retrieve something from your Obsidian vault, you're searching keywords. When you try to retrieve something from your actual brain, you might think "that thing I was reading when I was annoyed at that airport" and the whole cluster of associated memories lights up.

We've been treating digital notes like they're interchangeable with mental notes, when they're actually a much degraded format.

    Here are the beginnings of a pattern language for user interface design. These patterns drive the initial phases of design. They key off of Story, a pattern from the early development language. The patterns are:

1. User Decision
2. Task
3. Task Window

I'm indebted to the user interface pattern mailing list and to Ward Cunningham for the seeds for these patterns.

      How to disable Gemini on Android, Gmail, Chrome, Photos, & Google apps. Opt out of AI tracking now!

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Earlier this year, we warned you to turn off Gemini on Android because Google decided that its AI would have access to its users' apps - even if they had previously turned tracking for Gemini Apps Activity off. So regardless of whether you told Google’s Gemini not to track you in the past, its AI tool might be able to run tasks like send WhatsApp messages, set timers, and even make calls on your Android device. Worryingly, Google's AI invasion does not stop there. Now, Google has turned on settings like smart features, without your consent, and Gemini can scan your Gmail emails, Photos, Drive, and other apps. In this guide, we show you how to turn off Gemini on Android and all your Google apps – Gmail, Chrome, Photos, and more. Protect your privacy and your data from invasive AI tracking

      Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers : Studying the Impact of User Behaviors
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    The Information Technologies (IT) industry has an increasing carbon footprint (2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020), incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to mitigate climate change. Data centers hold a significant share due to their electricity consumption amounting to 1% of the global electricity consumption in 2018. To reduce this footprint, research has mainly focused on energy efficiency measures and use of renewable energy. While these works are needed, they also convey the risk of rebound effects, i.e., a growth in demand as a result of the efficiency gains. For this reason, it appears essential to accompany them with sufficiency measures, i.e., a conscious use of these technologies with the aim to decrease the total energy and resource consumption. In this thesis, we introduce a model for data centers and their users. In the first part, we focus on direct users, interacting with the infrastructure by submitting jobs. We define five sufficiency behaviors they can adopt to reduce their stress on the infrastructure, namely Delay, Reconfig, Space Degrad, Time Degrad and Renounce. We characterize these behaviors through simulation on real-world inputs. The results allow us to classify them according to their energy saving potential, impact on scheduling metrics and effort required from users.

  <section class="p-summary">
    This specification defines a Zstandard-based format for compressed WARC files, as an alternative to the GZIP-based format defined in WARC/1.1 Annex D.

In general, Zstandard can produce significantly smaller files than GZIP while also achieving faster compression and decompression. Zstandard also offers a much wider range of compression levels, ranging from extremely fast compression with a modest size reduction to extremely slow compression with a much better reduction. For files containing many small records, Zstandard dictionaries can be used to reduce file size even further, while still permitting random access to individual records.

  <section class="p-summary">
    A scathing critique of proposals to geoengineer our way out of climate disaster, by the bestselling authors of Overshoot

The world is crossing the 1.5°C global warming limit, perhaps exceeding 2°C soon after. What is to be done when these boundaries, set by the Paris Agreement, have been passed? In the overshoot era, schemes proliferate for muscular adaptation or for new technologies to turn the heat down at a later date by re­moving CO2 from the air or blocking sunlight. Such technologies are by no means safe; they come with immense risks and provide an excuse for those who would prefer to avoid limiting emissions in the present. But do they also hold out some potential? Can the catastrophe be reversed, masked or simply adapted to once it is a fact? Or will any such round­about measures simply make things worse?

The Long Heat maps the new front lines in the struggle for a liveable planet and insists on the climate revolution long overdue. In the end, no technology can absolve us of respon

      Edible Perennials for Community Preparedness

  <section class="p-summary">
    Perennials are plants that have a life cycle of at least three years—as opposed to annuals (plants that have to be grown from seed anew each year because they have a single-year lifecycle) and biennials (plants that spend a year growing and then another year producing seed and dying—so they have a two-year life cycle). Some perennial plants are herbaceous (meaning they have tender stalks that may die back in the cold season, then grow again from the root) and others are woody (meaning they have woody stalks that tend to continue growing above soil year after year), In this zine we are mainly discussing edible herbaceous perennials, but we will mention a few woody plants as well.

    In this project, we attempt to establish a large-scale soundscape monitoring network and characterize ecosystem-specific soundscapes by separating sounds from geophonic, biological, and anthropogenic sources. Based on information retrieval techniques, the acoustic data are transformed into metrics that describe the quality of acoustic habitat, the behavior of soniferous animals, and noise-generating activities. The outcomes will allow managers and stakeholders to use soundscape information to monitor the trends of marine ecosystems and perform data-driven decision making in conservation management.

Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time, and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).

Going forward, htmx will be developed with its existing users in mind.

    Diderot built the Encyclopédie because he believed that organizing knowledge properly could change how people thought. He spent two decades on it. He went broke. He watched collaborators quit and authorities try to destroy his work. He kept going because the infrastructure mattered, because how we structure the presentation of ideas affects the ideas themselves.

We're not going to get a better internet by waiting for platforms to become less extractive. We build it by building it. By maintaining our own spaces, linking to each other, creating the interconnected web of independent sites that the blogosphere once was and could be again.

    I'm building Scour, a personalized content feed that sifts through noisy feeds like Hacker News Newest, subreddits, and blogs to find great content for you. It works pretty well -- and it's fast. Scour is written in Rust and if you're building a website or service in Rust, you should consider using this "stack".

After evaluating various frameworks and libraries, I settled on a couple of key ones and then discovered that someone had written it up as a stack. Shantanu Mishra described the same set of libraries I landed on as the "mash 🥔 stack" and gave it the tagline "as simple as potatoes". This stack is fast and nice to work with, so I wanted to write up my experience building with it to help spread the word.

TL;DR: The stack is made up of Maud, Axum, SQLx, and HTMX and, if you want, you can skip down to where I talk about synergies between these libraries. (Also, Scour is free to use and I'd love it if you tried it out and posted feedback on the suggestions board!)
