  content: Actually, you have to pay for a <i>hard</i> copy of the standard, but Unicode
    4.0 has been free-as-in-beer-ly available online for some time now, and Unicode
    5.0 will be as soon as the book is published.

<p>Folks who are interested in libraries and technology are often drawn to the issue of open standards. Using open standards is very important to libraries for a variety of reasons that <a href="http://ecorrado.us">Ed Corrado</a> <a href="http://www.istl.org/05-spring/article2.html">summarizes</a> nicely.</p>
<p>This week my podcast reader picked up an excellent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070712091701/http://osc.gigavox.com/shows/detail1222.html">interview</a> with <a href="http://danesecooper.blogs.com/">Danese Cooper</a> of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osr/">Open Source Initiative</a> where she talks about the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osr/">Open Standard Requirement</a> which was introduced a few months ago. It provides a new perspective on the same issue from outside of the library community.</p>
<p>Essentially the OSR amounts to 5 guidelines for identifying a truly open standard. These guidelines are different though because they focus on what makes a standard open for an <em>implementor</em>. Whether the standard was created by an open process or not is really outside of scope. The important thing is how easy it is for a software developer to write software that uses the standard. A nice feature of the OSR is that the guidelines would fit on an index card. Here's my regurgitation of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The spec can't omit details needed for implementation</li>
<li>The standard needs to be freely/publicly available</li>
<li>All patents involved in the spec need to be royalty free</li>
<li>Clicking through a license agreement is not necessary</li>
<li>The spec can't be dependent on a standard that is not open as well</li>
</ol>
<p>Danese was quick to point out that these are simply guidelines and not rules. For example Unicode fails on 2. since you have to <a href="http://www.unicode.org/book/bookform.html">pay</a> for a copy of the spec. But in this case printing the standard is a publishing feat--given all the glyphs and their number. It's not unusual that the book would cost money. So this guideline could be waived if the OSI folks agreed.</p>
<p>Rather than the OSI going and applying these rules to all known standards the idea is that standards bodies could claim self-compliance--and as developers implement the standard the compliance will be ascertained.</p>
<p>The guidelines themselves and the process of being fine tuned/hammered on--and they are looking for volunteers...</p>
