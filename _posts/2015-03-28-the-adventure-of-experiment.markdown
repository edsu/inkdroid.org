<blockquote>
<p>Love of certainty is a demand for guarantees in advance of action. Ignoring the fact that truth can be bought only by the adventure of experiment, dogmatism turns truth into an insurance company. Fixed ends upon one side and fixed "principles" -- that is authoritative rules -- on the other, are props for a feeling of safety, the refuge of the timid, and the means by which the bold prey upon the timid.</p>
