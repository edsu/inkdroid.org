<p>I don't know ... but it sure is nice to <a href="https://arl.org/lists/sparc-oaforum/Message/3858.html">see</a> that 26 Nobel Laureates at least understand the direction libraries ought to be headed:</p>
<blockquote><p>As scientists and Nobel laureates, we are writing to express our strong support for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees’ recent directives to the NIH to enact a mandatory policy that allows public access to published reports of work supported by the agency. We believe that the time is now for Congress to enact this enlightened policy to ensure that the results of research conducted by NIH can be more readily accessed, shared and built upon ­ to maximize the return on our collective investment in science and to further the public good.<br />
...<br />
The public at large also has a significant stake in seeing that this research (researched funded by the National Institute of Health) is made more widely available. When a woman goes online to find what treatment options are available to battle breast cancer, she will find many opinions, but peer-reviewed research of the highest quality often remains behind a high-fee barrier. Families seeking clinical trial updates for a loved one with Huntington's disease search in vain because they do not have a journal subscription. Librarians, physicians, health care workers, students, journalists, and investigators at thousands of academic institutions and companies are currently hindered by unnecessary costs and delays in gaining access to publicly funded research results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exciting times for libraries and the medical profession! I just hope they can convince Congress.</p>
