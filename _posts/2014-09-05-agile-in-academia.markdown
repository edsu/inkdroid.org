    As someone who has recently read a lot of grant proposals for software projects I'd stress that I think there is an increasing understanding and desire even for people to move away from very detailed requirements docs and do more agile work.
    In that vein, I think it ends up meaning that in proposals we spend a lot more of our time describing 1) the big picture idea of what problem the software is going to solve 2) the initial decisions for what environments and platforms we are going to use and 3) the users we are going to work with.
    Along with that, I've increasingly seen grant proposals include workplans that have things like "Make paper prototype" followed by "do user testing" followed by a whole series of iterations with rounds of user feedback. So there are some good ways to go about describing that in a proposal.
    With that said, I'd imagine a lot of what you have is a bunch of existing projects. Things that have workplans and timelines etc. In that vein, I think it's worth stressing that, in general, when someone get's the money for a grant the workplan in there is really just a good faith effort at convincing the funder that you know what you are doing. It is not a contract to be followed to the letter. Ultimately, the grant winner really needs to have something to show for themselves at the end of the grant. So the only real timeline is the day the money needs to be spent by. Thus, when I have seen folks do this work well, it often involves a lot of pivoting to different tactics and approaches as they go while just keeping in mind that in the end there is a date that you need to have something to show for yourself.

<p>I'm just finishing up my first week at <a href="http://mith.umd.edu">MITH</a>. What a smart, friendly group to be a part of, and with such exciting prospects for future work. Riding along the Sligo Creek and Northwest Branch trails to and from campus certainly helps. Let's just say I couldn't be happier with my decision to join MITH, and will be writing more about the work as I learn more, and get to work.</p>
<p>But I already have a question, that I'm hoping you can help me with.</p>
<p>I've been out of academia for over ten years. In my time away I've focused on my role as an <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> software developer -- increasingly with a lower case "a". Working directly with the users of software (stakeholders, customers, etc), and getting the software into their hands as early as possible to inform the next iteration of work has been very rewarding. I've seen it work again, and again, and I suspect you have too on your own projects.</p>
<p>What I'm wondering is if you know of any tips, books, articles, etc on how to apply these agile practices in the context of grant funded projects. I'm still re-aquainting myself with how grants are tracked, and reported, but it seems to me that they seem to often encourage fairly detailed schedules of work, and cost estimates based on time spent on particular tasks, which (from 10,000 ft) reminds me a bit of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a>.</p>
<p>Who usually acts as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_Owner">product owner</a> in grant drive software development projects? How easy is it to adapt schedules and plans based on what you have learned in a past iteration? How do you get working software into the hands of its potential users as soon as possible? How often do you meet, and what is the focus of discussion? Are there particular funding bodies that appreciate agile software development? Are grants normally focused on publishing research and data instead of software products?</p>
<p>Any links, references, citations, tips or advice you could send my way here, <a href="http://twitter.com/edsu">@edsu</a>, or <a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">email</a> would be greatly appreciated. I've already got <a href="">Bethany Nowviskie</a>'s <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2012/lazy-consensus/">Lazy Consensus</a> bookmarked for re-reading :-)</p>
