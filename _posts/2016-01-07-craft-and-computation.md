@Cheatle:2015 provides an interesting view into how the funiture artist
[Wendell Castle] uses 3D scanning and digital fabrication tools in his work.
Usefully (for me) the description is situated in the larger field of 
human-computer interaction, and computer supported work, which I'm trying to
get a handle on, to see if it will help me in studying Web archiving practices
(more on that below). The article is definitely worth checking out if you are 
interested in a close look at how a small furniture studio (that has built an 
international reputation for craftsmanship) uses 3d scanning and robotics to 
do its work.

One fascinating piece of the story is the work of the studio director, Marvin
Pallischeck (aka Marv), who (amazingly) adapted a CNC machine designed for 
[pick-and-place] work in the US Postal Service, to serve as a 
[milling machine]. This robot is fed 3D scans of Castle's prototypes along 
with material (wood) and then goes about its work. The end result 
isn't a completed piece, but one that a woodcarver can then work with further 
to get it into its final shape. The 3d scanning is done by an offiste 
firm that does work in scanning wood. They deliver a CAD file that needs to 
be converted to a CAM file. The CAM file then needs to be adjusted to control 
the types of cutters and feed speeds that are used, to fit the particular wood 
being worked on.

The work is also iterative where the robot successively works on the parts of 
the whole piece, getting closer and closer with Marv's help. The process resists
complete automation:

> *At the end of the day, it's the physical properties of the
> material that drives our process*, says Marv as he
> describes the way the wood grain of a Castle piece can be
> read to determine the orientation of the tree’s growth within
> the forest. *I always say, this tree is now dead, but its wood
> is not - and it's important to know that going into this.*
> Bryon understands this in a similar way, *There’s a lot of
> tension in wood. When you start cutting it up, that tension
> is released, free to do as it will. And form changes. Things
> crack, they bend, and warp.*

There is also an impact on the clients perception of the work: its authenticity
and authorship. On the theoretical side, Cheatle and Jackson are drawing
attention to how the people, their creative processes, the computers and the 
materials they are working with, are all part of a network. As with Object
Oriented Ontology (@Bogost:2012 is cited), the lines between the human and the
non-human objects begin to get fuzzy, and complicated. More generally the 
interviews and ethnographic work point the work of [Wanda Orlikowski].

and then from the conclusion:

I think this is an angle I'm particularly interested in exploring with respect
to my research into how archivists work with the Web. How processes evolved
around physical artifacts (paper, film, audio, photographs, etc) are challenged
and strained by the material of the Web. With respect to this work by Cheatle 
and Jackson: the ways in which our Web archving tools (crawlers, viewers, 
inventory/appraisal tools) have been designed (or not) to fit the needs of 
archivists, and the ways in which archival work itself is changing. How are 
archivists, the medium of the Web, and the archival tools/processes entangled?
Can a better understanding of this entanglement inform the design of new 
archival tools, and the way we use them?

I think this article Cheatle and Jackson provides a nice pattern or blueprint 
for the how I would like to go about this examination of how archivists work 
with the Web. I'm imagining a study that applies the same ethnographic 
attention to detail to examine the work of Web archives. Granted its not an
internationally known artist, but I do think it's important! I also like how
this ethongraphic work is tied in with issues of human computer interaction
and the theoretical work of Olikowski and Bogost in particular. If you have any
ideas of people or organizations doing Web archives work to interview, or
theories, conceptual work that is relevant for archives please let me know!
appealing.
