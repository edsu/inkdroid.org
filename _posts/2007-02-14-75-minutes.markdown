  content: "I was wondering the same thing - in the Epilogue Mike implied that there
    were lots of other podcasts doing the same kind of thing, but I haven't found
    them.\r\n\r\nContrast Podcast was excellent the week - the 'my favourite 45' edition.
    So The Wind... is always consistently good too, in a different style. Neither
    of these cover the same breadth of punk/independent rock that 75 Minutes did though."

    they're coming up from behind."

<p>The <a href="http://75minutes.com/podcast/75-minutes-epilogue/">worst news</a> so far in 2007 after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007">the surge</a>. Can anyone else recommend a good podcast for independent music? I'm going to suffer...</p>
