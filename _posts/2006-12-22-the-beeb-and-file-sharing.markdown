<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6194929.stm"><img border="0" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left" src="/images/who.jpg" /></a>Recognizing and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6194929.stm">leveraging</a> the benefits of protocols like <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/bittorrent.org">bittorrent</a> in "legitimate" media distribution seems like a huge step forward. I guess I have to admit I'm also pretty excited about the prospect of .torrent files for <a href="http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/">Red Dwarf</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a> episodes. But, still there will be some kind of digital-rights-management built in, so it won't be totally open.</p>
