A segment from @Berg:1997a about the ways in which documents and records 
fix narratives. I think I picked up Berg's work from @Mol:2002. I particularly
like this notion of *document time* where experience is flattened, and then 
used in particular ways.

> insignificant these occurrences may seem [@Garfinkel:1967, pp. 197-207;
