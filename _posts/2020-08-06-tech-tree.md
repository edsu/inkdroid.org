I see that GitHub has released an initial version of their [Tech
Tree](https://github.com/github/archive-program/blob/master/TheTechTree.md)
document which will accompany the filmed git repositories they are depositing
into the Arctic Code Vault in Svalbard.

Scanning quickly over the included materials it is striking how Victorian this
whole project feels. While there is a section on Women in Technology, I wasn't
able to find anything about race or really much about the politics of software,
the Internet and computer technology in general.

They are, of course, accepting pull requests. A few no-brainer things that might
make sense to add:

- [Alogorithms of Oppression](http://algorithmsofoppression.com/) / Safiya Noble
- [Behind the Screen](https://www.behindthescreen-book.com/) / Sarah T. Roberts
- [Race After Technology](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology) / Ruha Benjamin
- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/) / Cathy O'Neill
- [Permanent Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)) / Edward Snowden
- [Automating Inequality](https://virginia-eubanks.com/) / Virginia Eubanks
- [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism) / Shoshana Zuboff

*This list should obviously go on for a bit right?*

There are lots of books about web development e.g. with Node or Flask or what
have you, but no books about where the web came from? Like maybe Tim
Berners-Lee's [Weaving the
Web](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html), or Janet
Abbate's [Inventing the
Internet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/inventing-internet). And why not throw
all the [IETF RFCs](https://ietf.org/standards/rfcs/) in there while we're at
it?

Of course, everything is in English except for some dictionaries and a Wikipedia
dump. Because, what else could you possibly need to understand computer
technology in the 21st century right?

One thing I didn't notice in the first round of publicity about this project is
that GitHub didn't build the Arctic vault themselves. The "future proof" film is
going to be deposited in the [Arctic World Archive](https://www.arcticworldarchive.org/), which is a collaboration between
a company called [Piql](https://www.piql.com) (how cute, "pickling") and a state
owned [coal mining
company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_Norske_Spitsbergen_Kulkompani) (not
so cute, guilty conscience anyone?) There is other stuff down there with the git
repos, you know, like the Vatican Library and Siemens' corporate documents.


I'm not sure I have time/energy to recommend things in pull requests--the effort
itself seems so romantic and fraught. But this sure would be an interesting
topic to write about in more detail. What do these choices they are making today
say about their perspective on technology today? Who are the users that they are
imagining in the future using this archive? What does this projection signify?
