      Don't buy a DAC for lossless audio. Get this instead
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    So yes, a DAC makes sense, but only if you stop there. If you’re trying to build an organized, reliable desktop listening setup, an audio interface makes far more sense than stacking separate DACs, amps, and adapters. Most standalone DACs focus solely on digital-to-analog conversion and little else. Meanwhile, an audio interface, even a simple one like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, does that job and adds features you’ll actually use every day.

      Postgres Internals Hiding in Plain Sight
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    The Postgres catalog is how Postgres keeps track of itself. Of course, Postgres would do this in a relational database with its own schema. Throughout the years several nice features have been added to the internal tables like psql tools and views that make navigating Postgres’ internal tables even easier.

Today I want to walk through some of the most important Postgres internal data catalog details. What they are, what is in them, and how they might help you understand more about what is happening inside your database.

My research examined how Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications like IIIF APIs and Linked Art fostered collaborative knowledge creation in cultural heritage, focusing on implementations in both the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) project and Yale’s LUX platform.

    In October 2023 the first official version of the General Metadata Profile for Educational Resources (AMB – Allgemeines Metadatenprofil für Bildungsressourcen) was published, a schema.org-based specification on how to describe educational resources with structured data in JSON-LD. Though the metadata profile was developed by and for German-speaking OER initiatives, it may well be worth adapting in other contexts.

  <section class="p-summary">
    “A Machine-Shaped Hand” is a clever piece of propaganda. Its elevation of AI to the status of the quasi-sentient and its reduction of human subjects to interchangeable avatars for the reader’s grief provide a convenient distraction from the grief of real people mourning the wholesale denigration of the values and assumptions that Altman’s end-of-millennial predecessors and Silicon Valley contemporaries have systematically laid waste to in the name of dynamic innovation: namely, the right to a fair wage, stability of employment, and scope to think (the latter of which depends on the former two), not to mention the basic premise that writing is a craft and should, in fact, require effort.

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Ufotofu is a Rust library of abstractions (“streams” and “sinks”) for asynchronously working with series of data — except we call them producers and consumers, and have strong opinions about the API designs.

An ufotofu sequence consists of an arbitrary number of repeated items, terminated by at most one final value. A producer yields these values one at a time; a consumer receives them one at a time. Both traits can emit an error on any method call.

and won. and won. and won and won and fucking won. the accidental benefits of
the free software movement: a global community working asynchronously, sharing
code without pay. these important, critical benefits, which were responsible for
the absolute dominance of things like gcc, the gnu coreutils, and linux - have
been hopelessly devoured
