I just made a donation to the [Dark Reader] project over on [Open Collective].
If you haven't seen it before Dark Reader is a browser plugin (Firefox, Chrome,
Edge, Safari) that lets you enable [dark mode] on websites that don't support
it. It has lots of useful configuration settings, and allows you to easily turn
it on and off for particular web sites.

For most of my life I've actually preferred light backgrounds for my text
editor. But for the past year or so as my [eyes] have gotten worse I've enabled
dark mode in Vim and gradually in any application or website that will let me.

I'm not an eye doctor, but it seems that the additional light from the screen
reflects off of whatever material constitutes the cataracts in the lenses of my
eyes, which causes everything to fuzz out, and for text to become basically
illegible. Being able to turn on dark mode has meant I've been able continue to
read online, although it still can be difficult. Dark Reader lets me turn on
dark mode for other websites that don't support it, which has been a real *life
saver*. So it was nice to be able to say thank you.

Just as an aside, I've been using Open Collective for a few years now, to
donate regularly to the [social.coop] project which is how I'm doing social
media these days. Realizing Dark Reader was on Open Collective too made me
think how I should really look at more open source projects to support that are
on there. It also made me think that perhaps Open Collective could be a useful
platform for the [Documenting the Now] project to look at to support some of
the tools it has developed, as the project draws down on its grant funding and
moves into sustaining some of the things it has started. Perhaps it would be
useful for other projects like [Webrecorder] potentially too?

PS. It's enabled here on my blog for people who have their browser/os set to
dark mode.
