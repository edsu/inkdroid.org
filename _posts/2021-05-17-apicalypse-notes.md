I'm giving a short presentation as part of a panel tomorrow at the [UMD Social
Data Science Center](https://socialdatascience.umd.edu/) with the title "Notes
from the APIcalypse: The Twitter V2 API".

It's an obvious riff off of Axel Bruns' instant classic [After the APIcalypse:
social media platforms and their fight against critical scholarly
research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1637447)
which details the events and aftermath of the [Cambridge Analytica
controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).

I've spent some time over the past few months working with people from the
[Documenting the Now](https://www.docnow.io) project updating some of our tools
to work with the new Twitter V2 API and thought I could use this talk as an
opportunity to pause and quickly reflect on some of that.

I'm not sure it will be recorded, and wanted to practice the talk beforehand,
so here's a recording of that if you are interested:
