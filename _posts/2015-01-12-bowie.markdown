My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1165872948">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>If you are a Bowie fan, you will definitely enjoy this. If you are curious why other people are so into Bowie you will enjoy this. If you've never read any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Critchley">Critchley</a> and are interested in something quick and accessible by him you will enjoy this. I fell into the first and third categories so I guess I'm guessing about the second. But I suspect it's true.</p>
<p>I finished the book feeling like I understand the why and how of my own fascination with Bowie's work much better. I also want to revisit some of his albums like Diamond Dogs, Heathen and Outside which I didn't quite connect with at first. I would've enjoyed a continued discussion of Bowie's use of the cutup technique, but I guess that fell out of the scope of the book.</p>
<p>I also want to read some more Critchley too -- so if you have any recommendations please let me know. The sketches at the beginning of each chapter are wonderful. <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">OR Books</a> continues to impress.</p>
