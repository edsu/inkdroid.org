It can be difficult to have a conversation in Twitter but people somehow seem to
manage.  You can reply to someone's tweet, and other people can reply to your
replies, which forms a conversation thread of sorts. But the display of the
thread is difficult to interpret.

What's worse is that there is no Twitter API call to get the replies to a given
tweet. If you have the JSON for a tweet in hand you can use the
`in_reply_to_status_id` property to fetch the tweet that it is responding to.
But the converse is not true: there is no straightforward way to get the tweets
that are in response to a given tweet.  If I'm wrong about that [please let me
know](mailto:ehs@pobox.com). For a much more thorough discussion and analysis of
these constraints see [Alexander Nwala](https://twitter.com/acnwala)'s [Tweet
Visibility Dynamics in a Tweet Conversation
Graph](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2016/07/2016-07-18-tweet-visibility-dynamics-in.html).

It's a bit of a hack but you can use Twitter's [Search
API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets) to
programmatically scan through tweets directed at a given user (e.g.
`to:barackobama`), and inspect them to see if any are in response to a given
tweet. You can also stop scanning when you arrive at tweets that are older than
the tweet you are looking for responses to, since to my knowledge it's
impossible to reply to a tweet from the future. Yeah, that was my dry attempt at
a joke. The big caveat here is that Twitter's Search API only allows you to
retrieve tweets from the last week. So this technique will only work for
fetching conversation threads from the last week.

In the [Documenting the Now](http://www.docnow.io) project we are building tools
to help researchers study Twitter. We've added a command to
[twarc](https://github.com/docnow/twarc) that performs this heuristic to rebuild
a given reply thread for a given tweet identifier. So to get the replies to this
tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">letâ€™s make this shit huge <a href="https://t.co/iP8IOY3CqB">https://t.co/iP8IOY3CqB</a></p>&mdash; laura olin (\@lauraolin) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauraolin/status/824077910927691778">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

you can run this command:

<pre>
% twarc replies 82407791092769177 > replies.json
</pre>

This will only get the initial set of replies to the tweet. If you want to get
the entire conversation thread you can use the `--recursive` option:

<pre>
% twarc replies 82407791092769177 --recursive > replies.json
</pre>

That will get the replies to the replies, and will also walk up the conversation
chain if the supplied tweet identifier is itself a reply to another tweet. In
addition it will follow tweets that are quotes.

To demonstrate that it's working we've added a little utility called
[network.py](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc/blob/master/utils/network.py) that
will read a set of tweets and write out the network of conversation as a
[GEXF](https://gephi.org/gexf/format/) for loading into
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/), or
[DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29) for
use with [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) or as a standalone HTML file that uses
[D3](https://d3js.org/) to visualize the conversation in your browser. Here's
how you run it:

<pre>
% ./network.py replies.json replies.html
</pre>

and here's what the D3 visualization looks like for that tweet above. Try
clicking on the nodes in the graph to see the tweets that the node represents.
You can see the quote is colored yellow, and the original tweet (the one with no
parent) is colored red.

[Paul Butler](https://twitter.com/paulgb) also recently added the ability to
drag and drop a file of tweets generated with the twarc replies command in his
[Treeverse](https://paulgb.github.io/Treeverse/). Treeverse is a Chrome
plugin which provides a much more usable display of a conversation thread.
Here's a screenshot of looking at that same set of replies.

The nice thing about the D3 vidualization is that it's possible to restyle the
presentation using CSS. You can also use it to visualize the network of tweets
that were not acquired using the `replies` command. For example here is a
visualization that was generated from a search for the <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=datarefuge">#datarefuge</a> hashtag a few
days ago. I recorded it as a video on a large screen because there were so many
nodes.

If you get a chance to try any of this or have any thoughts about it I'd love 
to hear from you.
