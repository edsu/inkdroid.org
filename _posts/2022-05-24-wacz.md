I'm fortunate to be back at [code4lib](https://2022.code4lib.org) again this year. It gives me hope to see this conference working in the same spirit as it started out with, albeit with much honed mechanics. It is also refreshing to be talking about someone else's work, in this case the work of the [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net) project, rather than my own.

Rather than archived content from the web being placed into repositories, web archives are typically repository infrastructures in and of themselves. I call this pattern web archive **as** a repository, compared with web archives **in** a repository.

The *classic* shape of web archives has been (perhaps necessarily) designed to be monolithic. Consequently it has evolved into a fairly expensive infrastructure, that only a few institutions are able to sustain over time (the purpose of digital repositories).

One of Webrecorder's primary contributions over the past few years has been the creation of a data format known as [Web Archive Collection Zipped](https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz/latest/) or WACZ, which allows this monolithic architecture to be teased apart by separating the process of creating an archive, from the process of publishing it. I think this sets the stage for a more diverse set of actors who perform each of these steps, and also raises some important questions about what social and political impacts this could have.

I recorded a practice version of the talk to make sure I could squeeze all the content into the 15 minute slot. Here it is if you are interested:
