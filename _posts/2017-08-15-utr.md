I've always intended to use this blog as more of a place for rough working notes
as well somewhat more fully formed writing. So in that spirit here are some
rough notes for some digging into a collection of tweets that used the
#unitetheright hashtag. Specifically I'll describe a way of determining what
tweets have been deleted.

*Note: be careful with the deleted Twitter data. Specifically be careful about
how you publish it on the web. Users delete content for lots of reasons.
Republishing deleted data on the web could be seen as a form of
[Doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing). I'm documented this procedure
for identifying deleted tweets because it can provide insight into how
particularly toxic information is traveling on the web. Please use discretion in
how you put this to use.*

So I started by building a dataset of #unitetheright data using
[twarc](https://github.com/docnow/twarc):

    twarc search '#unitetheright' > tweets.json

I waited two days and then was able to gather some information about the
tweets that were deleted. I was also interested in what content and websites
people were linking to in their tweets because of the implications this has for
web archives. Here are some basic stats about the dataset:

**number of tweets**: 165,314

**collected at**: 2017-08-13 11:46:05 EDT

**date range**: 2017-08-04 11:44:12 - 2017-08-13 15:45:39 UTC

**tweets deleted**: 16,492 (9.9%)

## Deletes

So how do you get a sense of what has been deleted from your data?
While it might make sense to write a program to do this eventually, I find it
can be useful to work in a more a more exploratory way on the command line
first and then when I've got a good workflow I can put that into a program. I
guess if I were a real *data scientist* I would be doing this in R or a Jupyter
notebook at least. But I still enjoy working at the command line, and this
isn't my fulltime job, so here are the steps I took to identify tweets that
had been deleted from the original dataset:

First I extracted and sorted the tweet identifiers into a separate file using
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

    jq -r '.id_str' tweets.json | sort -n > ids.csv

Then I hydrated those ids with twarc. If the tweet has been deleted since
it was first collected it cannot be hydrated:

    twarc hydrate ids.csv > hydrated.json

I extracted these hydrated ids:

    jq -r .id_str hydrated.json | sort -n > ids-hydrated.csv

Then I used diff to compare the pre and post hydration ids, and used a little
bit of Perl to strip of the diff formatting, which results in a file of tweet
ids that have been deleted.

    diff ids.txt ids-hydrated.txt | perl -ne 'if (/< (\d+)/) {print "$1\n";}' > ids-deleted.csv

Since we have the data that was deleted we can now build a file of just deleted
tweets. Maybe there's a fancy way to do this on the command line but I found
it easiest to write a little bit of Python to do it:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/edsu/909cf8dfcc14b6dff7b879db4491c049.js"></script>

After you run it you should have a file *delete.json*. You might want to
convert it to CSV with something like twarc's [json2csv.py] utility to
inspect in a spreadsheet program.

Calling these tweets *deleted* is a bit of a misnomer. A user could have deleted
their tweet, deleted their account, protected their account or Twitter could
have decided to suspend the users account. Also, the user could have done none
of these things and simply retweeted a user who had done one of these things.
Untangling what happened is left for another blog post. To be continued...
