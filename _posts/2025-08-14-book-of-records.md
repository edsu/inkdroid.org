I recently finished [Madeleine Thien]'s [The Book of Records] and found this in the acknowledgements at the end:

> *The Book of Records*, guided by histories, letters, philosophies, poetry, mathematics and physics, is a work of the imagination. I am indebted to the library, and to librarians, archivists and translators, for their companionship and light--they are the steadfast keepers of the building made of time.

I like how this blends the people and infrastructure of libraries and record keeping, and recognizes them as partners in imagination. Reading and writing are the central theme, of this beautiful book, which David Naimon describes well in the opening to his extended [interview] with her:

> The Book of Records is many things: a book of historical fiction and speculative fiction, a meditation on time and on space-time,  on storytelling and truth, on memory and the imagination, a book that impossibly conjures the lives and eras of the philosopher Baruch Spinoza, the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu and the political theorist Hannah Arendt not as mere ghostly presences but portrayed as vividly and tangibly as if they lived here and now in the room where we hold this very book. But most of all this is a book about books, about words as amulets, about stories as shelters, about novels as life rafts, about strangers saving strangers, about friendships that defy both space and time, about choosing, sometimes at great risk to oneself, life and love.

I will add that the underlying theme of being a refugee from various forms of fascism and totalitarianism amidst a catastrophically changing climate really speaks to our moment--especially considering that the book took her ten years to write.

I heard in the interview that Thien worked through copying Spinoza's [Ethics] as an exercise while writing The Book of Records. I don't know if I'm going to do this, but I did enjoy the sections on Spinoza a lot, and previously enjoyed reading about how his philosophy informed [Joyful Militancy], so I got a copy too. Fun fact: [George Eliot] (Mary Ann Evans) wrote the first English translation of Ethics in 1856, but it sat unpublished until 1981.
