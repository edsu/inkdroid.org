I've never really been a huge fan of the [Basecamp Philosophy] of software
development--especially since the [no-politics] fiasco. Calling it
a *philosophy* is probably giving it a lot more credit than it deserves, since
it largely seems to be thinly veiled marketing.

But I'll admit to having liked one idea that they promulgated since the early
days of Ruby on Rails: **that software should be [opinionated].**

The hero narrative of the individual software developer or software user having
an opinion and voicing it through the design or use of some software seems
wrongheaded. Software is made and used by people in groups, whether that group
is realized and cultivated or not.

However the basic idea here that software expresses opinions, and for designers
and users to consciously express those opinions is a useful way to to think
about design.

But the thing *Your App Should Take Sides* really gets wrong is the suggestion
that it's possible for an app not to express opinions--as if one could do
otherwise, and that some kind of neutrality is possible.

Software *always* takes sides, and expresses opinions--and often
embodies *multiple *opinions in several arguments or controversies, rather than
just one.

The question is, do you understand the opinions it is expressing, and the
decisions that are being made to express them? How can these decisions be
negotiated as a group that includes the designers and users of the software?
Hint: it works best when there is significant overlap between the two.
