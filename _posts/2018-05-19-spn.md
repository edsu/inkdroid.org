I've been doing some exploratory work over in a [Jupyter Notebook] to look at
the rate of ingest in the Internet Archive's Save-Page-Now (SPN) functionality.
SPN allows anyone with a web browser to go to the Internet Archive's [Wayback
Machine] and add a webpage to the archive. According to Brewster Kahle (Internet
Archive's Director) SPN is currently seeing up to 100 URLs being added *every
second*

<br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">651,621,510,000 web URL&#39;s now in the Wayback Machine by <a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@internetarchive</a> .   Billions and Billions of web pages!  users hitting &quot;save page now&quot; at 100 per second:  <a href="https://t.co/AWpIBUrEW1">https://t.co/AWpIBUrEW1</a></p>&mdash; Brewster Kahle (@brewster_kahle) <a href="https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/994380510011928578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

This is an *astonishing* rate for an archival process -- but the Internet
Archive isn't just any archive. Part of the reason for this is Internet Archive
have made it extremely easy to add a URL via SPN. All you have to do is issue an
HTTP GET request to:

<pre>
https://web.archive.org/save/{url-to-save-here}
</pre>

[PastPages] have even created a little [utility] to save URLs from
the command line if that's your thing. I would guess that there is quite a bit
of automation at work that are adding things to the Internet Archive.
I guess I know because I've written [some] [myself].

So what does the ingest rate look like? Here's what I was able to determine
using publicly available metadata made available via Internet Archive's API. The
content itself isn't publicly available I think for privacy reasons.

Head over to the [Jupyter Notebook] itself to see more about how it was done.
