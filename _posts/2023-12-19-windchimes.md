It's been a windy few days here at the tail end of 2023. My Mom and Dad gave me these wind-chimes because I had mentioned to Mom that I liked the sound of them at their house. They got me a similar one, I think from Maine somewhere. I always think of them when the wind picks up and they sing for a little.
