[Ilya Kreymer] recently asked a question over in [Documenting the Now Slack] about whether
Twitter's API data includes information about whether a tweet has been labeled
as *disinformation*. This structured data is important for building tools that
help trace how disinformation is propagating in Twitter and social media more
generally. It also can provide a view into how Twitter themselves are working to
combat the problem.

I've looked for the disinformation label in Twitter API JSON before and not seen
it. But I figured it couldn't hurt to look again so I used [this example]. Once
installed it's a snap to fetch the JSON data for a tweet with [twarc]:

    twarc tweet 1297495295266357248

I've included the data below here and as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/edsu/3271d6aec4a2ed9192065425c9aeb56b). I don't see anything related to the label, do you?

I also took the opportunity to look at Twitter's new [v2 API] and see how the
tweet looks there
([gist](https://gist.github.com/edsu/2e039cc078e1bb5a2e69940c8ff99e17)). In case
you want to give it a try yourself I put the code I used up in [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/edsu/1e2c4fc2ea2dae90ea8fb660b708e690).

I still didn't see it, but maybe I wasn't squinting right? I did see that
according to the data that Donald Trump is in the class of *Person* who are
"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela". I mean yes, but no.

When using the [v2 API] you need to indicate in the request what *fields* you
would like to have in the response. There are a set of names for the types of
fields, such as `media.fields`, `tweet.fields`, `place.fields`, `poll.fields`
and `user.fields`. Each of these field types has an enumerated set of assocated
values like `duration_minutes` for a poll, or `context_annotations` for a tweet,
etc.

There are lots of these enumerated values so I started by just requesting all of
them. Interestingly this failed, and the error message I received indicated that
I had requested field values that required elevated privileges. Once I removed
these from the request I was able to get back the JSON I pasted above.

This little error message did provide a glimpse of what data Twitter don't
provide to regular API developer accounts through the v2 API. For example I had
to remove `non_public_metrics` from `media_fields` and `tweet_fields` because
the following fields required additional permissions:

* non_public_metrics.impression_count
* non_public_metrics.url_link_clicks
* non_public_metrics.user_profile_clicks

Similarly I had to remove `organic_metrics` from `media.fields` and
`tweet.fields` because the following fields required additional permissions:

* organic_metrics.impression_count
* organic_metrics.like_count
* organic_metrics.reply_count
* organic_metrics.retweet_count
* organic_metrics.url_link_clicks
* organic_metrics.user_profile_clicks

And finally I had to remove `promoted_metrics` from `media.fields` and
`tweet.fields` because the following fields required additional permissions:

* promoted_metrics.impression_count
* promoted_metrics.like_count
* promoted_metrics.reply_count
* promoted_metrics.retweet_count
* promoted_metrics.url_link_clicks
* promoted_metrics.user_profile_clicks

Many of these seem to be present in the [v1.1 Metrics API] but it's interesting
that the new API is folding that functionality in to the representation of
tweets. I did notice that the `public_metrics` counts were all zero, so I guess they are still getting v2 working:

```json
"public_metrics": {
	"retweet_count": 0,
	"reply_count": 0,
	"like_count": 0,
	"quote_count": 0
}
```

As much as I might wish that to be true I know it's not. For the meantime it
might be useful to get support in a scraping tool like [twint] to see if this
important metadata could be pulled out of the page.
