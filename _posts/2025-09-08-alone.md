I thought this quote from [Ursula K. Le Guin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin)'s [Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) speaks to the ethnographic method. Here, the character Estraven, a native of the planet Gethen, is asking Genly Ai why he has come alone as a visitor to the planet, and he responds:

> Alone, I cannot change your world. But I can be changed by it. Alone, I must listen, as well as speak. Alone, the relationship I finally make, if I make one, is not impersonal and not only political: it is individual, it is personal, it is both more and less than political. Not We and They; not I and It; but I and Thou. Not political, not pragmatic, but mystical.

Of course UKLG was no stranger to ethnography and the role of cultural observers, both her parents were anthropologists, and she studied the subject. It's ironic though, because the character of Genly Ai does have a profound effect on the planetary civilization of Gethen...but it's not through some activity he performs alone, but through his relationships with others that it comes about.
