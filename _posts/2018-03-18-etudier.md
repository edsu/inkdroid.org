*TL;DR - [étudier] is a command line utility for saving an article's network of
citing literature from Google Scholar as a GEXF file for viewing in [Gephi], and
as a (currently very bare bones) D3 network visualization for viewing in a web
browser.*

Periodically I discover a new piece of research I really like, and I want to
know who else is citing it to see how it fits into the larger research
landscape. Ever since [Eugene Garfield] dreamed up the citation index, we've
been able to trace citation links forwards, to see who is citing an article. Of
course a side effect of this has been the contentious field of [scientometrics]
in which the impact of research is purportedly measured. Fifty years later
[Google Scholar] offers this same functionality, by scraping scholarly
publication metadata from publisher and repository websites, and building a
database that lets see what research is citing something with the click of a
link.

<img style="border: thin solid #ddd;" class="img-responsive" src="/images/scholar-cited.png">

It's kind of poignant that Google provide this functionality because their own
[PageRank] algorithm for ranking web search results was [directly influenced] by
Garfield, who died last year.

### Got Data?

I recently went looking around for techniques to collect this network of close
relationships around an article from Google Scholar. Ideally Scholar would have
an API that provided structured metadata for research publications. But Google
does not make an API available, probably because of the [privileged access] it
receives from publishers like Elsevier, who have a vested interest in there
*not* being a Google Scholar API.

I briefly looked at the [Web of Science API], which has an [endpoint] for
looking up citing articles. However it appears that access to the API is not
guaranteed even if you are lucky enough to belong to an institution that pays
for access to Web of Science. Futhermore API access is tiered (lite or premium)
and tracing the links between articles requires *premium* access. Lastly the
endpoint uses SOAP which is a little bit painful to use. I can understand why
full access might be limited to business partners, but I was really just
interested in looking at the immediate network of relationships around an
article, not in getting some global picture of citations.

Then I ran across [Jimmy Tidey]'s excellent [Scraping Google Scholar to write
your PhD literature
chapter](https://mystudentvoices.com/scraping-google-scholar-to-write-your-phd-literature-chapter-2ea35f8f4fa1)
which describes his tool
[Bibnet](https://github.com/jimmytidey/bibnet-google-scholar-scraper) which does
exactly what I wanted: collects the data around a particular publication from
Google Scholar. I did manage to get it running locally, but couldn't quite seem
to get it to work. It involves running a local web application in combination
with a Chrome extension. Tidey also made the application available as a service
at [whocites.com](https://whocites.com), but I kind of got cold feet after
seeing the invalid SSL certificate. Also the application seemed to do a lot more
than I wanted: it has a backend database where citations are stored. I just
wanted to get the network of citations out and move on to visualizing them and
doing the reading.

### Étudier

So, [somewhat predictably], I decided to write my own tool. [étudier] is a
command line utility written in Python that uses [Selenium] and [requests-html]
to automatically drive a browser to collect a citation graph around a particular
Scholar citation. The resulting network is written out as a [Gephi] file and a
[D3] visualization using [networkx]. The D3 visualization could use some
work, so if you add style to it please submit a pull request.

To use etudier.py you first need to find a citation you are interested in on
Google Scholar, and click on its *Cited By* link. For example here is the Cited
By URL for Sherry Ortner's influential Theory in Anthropology since the Sixties:

[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17950649785549691519&hl=en&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17950649785549691519&hl=en&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21)

With this URL in hand you can run etudier.py:

    etudier.py 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17950649785549691519&hl=en&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21'

This will collect the ten citations on the page, and then examine each one to
see what cites them. If you want you can collect more than the first page using
the *--pages* option:

    etudier.py --pages 2 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17950649785549691519&hl=en&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21'

And you can also collect the research that cites the research that cites your 
article by using the *--depth* option:

    etudier.py --depth 2 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17950649785549691519&hl=en&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21'

It's unlikely you'll want to use a --depth greater than 2, because only
examining the first page of results will build a network of up to 1000 citations, which starts to get difficult to visualize.

If you are wondering why it uses a non-headless browser it's because Google is
quite protective of this data and routinely will ask you to solve a [CAPTCHA]
(identifying street signs, cars, etc in photos).  *étudier* will allow you to
complete these tasks when they occur and then will continue on its way
collecting data.

### D3

The network is written out as an HTML file that uses D3 to visualize the data.
Here you can see a network generated for the Ortner article I mentioned above.

<img style="border: thin solid #ddd;" class="img-responsive"
src="/images/scholar-d3.png">

I'm hovering over an article that is at the center of a cluster of citations so
I can see its title: *Situated Learning: Legitimate peripheral participation* by
Lave and Wenger. Clicking on the nodes should open a new page and bring your
browser to what Google Scholar thinks is the webpage for the publication.

### Gephi

Hopefully the D3 visualization can be improved a bit, but given that the
resulting networks can be different it might be difficult to find a one size
fits all solution. So the data is also saved as a GEXF file that can be loaded
into [Gephi] where it can be massaged. Here is a visualization I made of 693
publications that I collected for the Ortner article with *--depth 2*.

<img style="border: thin solid #ddd;" class="img-responsive"
src="/images/scholar-gephi.png">

When I opened the Gephi file it looked like a giant hairball, which is not
unusual.  Describing how to use Gephi is a bit beyond the scope of this post,
but there are lots of videos on YouTube for working with Gephi. I [bookmarked] a
few that I found particularly useful.

In the example above I filtered the network to only include articles that had 10
or more citations (in-degree >= 10). I then ran community detection and colored
the nodes based on their community and applied a *Force Atlas* layout to arrange
the nodes. Finally I made the node size relative the number of inbound
citations.  With a little finagling you can hover over the nodes to see what
they are.

### Search Results

You can also visualize generic search results. So for example [this search] for
*cscw memory* to find papers from CSCW that mention the word memory. I collect
the first three pages of results and generated this graph of citations that
allows me to see the clusters of results:

    etudier.py --pages 3 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C21&q=cscw+memory&btnG='

<img style="border: thin solid #ddd;" class="img-responsive" src="/images/scholar-search-gephi.png">

This particular graph was constructed in a similar way to the Gephi graph above
except that the nodes are weighted by the total number of times they are cited
in the literature. In theory these little snapshots can help guide reading when
investigating a new domain.

### The Metadata

If you peak in the `output.html` you'll see the JSON metadata which is also
present in the GEXF file. Here's an example:

```json
{
	"id": "17379254502391608120",
	"url": "https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358992",
	"title": "FieldWise: a mobile knowledge management architecture",
	"authors": "H Fagrell, K Forsberg, J Sanneblad",
	"year": "2000",
	"cited_by": 102,
	"cited_by_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17379254502391608120&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21&hl=en"
}
```

You can use this metadata in the visualization, as I did above when I wanted to vary the size of the node in Gephi using the number of times a publication was cited: `cited_by`.

So, if you are looking for some help doing a literature review and have a chance
to try out etudier I'd be interested to hear how it works for you. As with many
scraping applications it is quite brittle, and if Google changes its HTML markup
it's liable to break. So please file an [issue] in GitHub if you noticed that
has happened.
