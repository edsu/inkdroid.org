I've recently shifted gears from data collection to data analysis in my
dissertation research--so of course what better time to navel gaze on the tools
I'm using, rather than doing the work itself, right?

Well, not really.

Early in my PhD studies I went through a phase where I spent a significant chunk
of time trying different citing and writing tools, before settling on collecting
materials with [BibDesk] and [DropBox], writing in [Markdown] with [WriteRoom]
(sometimes [Vim] or [VSCode]), and then publishing with [Pandoc]. It hasn't been
perfect, but it has let me collect about 2k citations to the research
literature, and to be able to easily draw on them in my written work in
articles, my dissertation proposal, and here on this blog, which has been super
handy.

Markdown kind of sucks for workshopping text with others. There are [some tools]
for collaborating with others on Markdown text, but it can be challenging to
get academics to use them when their time is so limited. So I've tended to give
people Word docs or PDFs (generated with Pandoc), and solicit people's feedback
that way. Then the challenge is integrating those suggestions back into the
original source. This means the track changes feature in Word or Google Docs
don't work right, but if people are interested in that level of granularity they can
look at the Git repository...yep, using Markdown files means my manuscripts can all
happily be versioned in a Git repository. While the collaborative lure of live
editing in a Google Doc is a strong pull, I've actually come to appreciate the
degree of separation that editing Markdown provides. It gives me a protective
space in which to think.

Now I'm in the process of converting hundreds of pages of hand written field
notes in a couple notebooks into text documents that I can use as a source
material for [open coding]. For my last project I ended up using [MAXQDA] for
qualitative data analysis after experimenting with [Dedoose] and [NVivo]. I was
happy with it, but it wasn't cheap, even with the educational license, which
expired after a semester.

Close reading field notes and interviews is key to my method, and being able to
annotate the text with *codes* is extremely important for coming to understand,
and use, my data. But honestly all the bells and whistles built into the tools
were not so important for me. I liked to see my codes, and bring up chunks of
text for particular codes. But that was the extent of my analysis. I built
themes out of the codes and used the codes as an index into my data. But I
didn't tend to use any of the other statistical tools that were available. 

So this time around I'm trying something different. Because I am transcribing my
own hand written notes, I'm going to write them as Markdown (basically text
files), and then "mark up" regions of texts with codes using HTML, which is
perfectly legit to use in Markdown files. I could have done this
keying/annotating work in MAXQDA which provides a way to compose documents, but
I was kind of surprised to find that NVivo didn't have this capability--it
really likes to be pointed at completed documents, instead of providing an
environment for creating them.

Out of habit I use [Vim] for editing text because I reach for it for coding
after being forced off Emacs by a boss 20 years ago. I briefly looked at writing
a Vim plugin for marking up text quickly but Vimscript is truly arcane. Truth be
told, for editing Node/JavaScript projects I've actually been using [VSCode] more these
days (with Vim key bindings), which (for me) has a [much saner] plugin
environment.

So I created a very simple VSCode plugin I'm calling [Anselm] (named after
[Anselm Strauss]) that makes it easy (with a few keystrokes) to highlight an
arbitrary region of text in a Markdown document and mark it up with code,
expressed with a &lt;mark&gt; tag. 

So for example, assume I have this bit of text in my field notes:

```html
Some heavy machinery, bulldozers mostly were also there.  To the right was a cement structure with multiple large diagonal entrances.  I missed the sign pointed to the right for Yard Waste and ended up on a road that led out of the facility. I thought about turning around but it was a one way road.  There was another person in a truck at the exit who was watching people leave. I felt a bit like my movement through the facility was controlled.
```

Anselm will let you quickly (faster if you assign a keyboard shortcut) assign simple codes to pieces of the text:

```html
Some <mark class="technology">heavy machinery, bulldozers mostly were also there</mark>.  To the right was a <mark class="architecture">cement structure with multiple large diagonal entrances</mark>. I missed the sign pointed to the right for Yard Waste and ended up on a road that led out of the facility. I thought about turning around but it was a one way road. <mark class="surveillance">There was another person in a truck at the exit who was watching people leave. I felt a bit like my movement through the facility was controlled.</mark>
```

The plugin is so simple it seems barely worth mentioning. You can see it in
operation in the video at the top of this blog post. I am writing about it here
really just to give encouragement to you to develop the tools *you* need in your
research.  There is significant value in understanding how your research tools
operate, and to being able to shape them to do what you need. There is also
value in getting the research done, and not focusing on the tools themselves. So
it's a balancing act to be sure.

Also there's another latent lesson here for me, summed up in the words of
[Graydon Hoare], as: [You can always bet on text].

Just using text for my field notes, means I can analyze it as text and not be
limited by what MAXQDA or NVivo lets me do. I'm going to give it a try for a
bit. If you want to try it out yourself you can find it in the VSCode plugin app
store, just search for "Anselm".

Finally, research is an opportunity to not only generate new findings (or
knowledge) but also to develop new instruments and methods (practice). I
certainly haven't done anything revolutionary in creating this tiny VSCode
plugin; but it has granted me the chance to reflect on what is happening when I
code text in this way, and opened up other possibilities for its analysis later
that would have been foreclosed by the limits of someone else's tool.

But yeah, on with the analysis! ðŸ“™ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š I'll probably be adding little bits and
pieces to Anselm as I go. If you have ideas for it drop them into them in
