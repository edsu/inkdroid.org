From Thich Nhat Hanh in [How to Focus](https://www.parallax.org/product/how-to-focus/):

> The contemplation on impermanence can help us live our life with the insight
> of impermanence so we can be free from many afflictions such as anger, fear,
> and delusion. It isn't the idea or notion of impermanence, but the insight of
> impermanence that can free and save us. Impermanence is not a negative note in
> the song of life. If there were no impermanence, life would be impossible.
> Without impermanence how could your little girl grow up and become a young
> woman? Without impermanence how could you hope to transform your suffering? You
> can hope to transform your suffering because you know it is impermanent. So
> impermanence is something positive. We should say, "Long Live Impermanence!"

I think working in digital preservation, and as a memory worker in general, it's easy to see impermanence as a, if not the, enemy. If you are thinking about a specific item in isolation, say a computer file, or an archival document, it kind of is. But if you focus your attention on the information artifact for a little bit you often come to discover that it is actually related to other artifacts and entities that may or may not still available, and that it is already incomplete, in many ways. This incompleteness is what gives the artifact value, and makes it worth preserving, and is also why exact preservation of its current state isn't always possible. Forever is mental trap that causes anxiety and suffering.
