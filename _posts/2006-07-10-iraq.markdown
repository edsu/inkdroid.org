<p>I saw this in yesterday's Washington Post and just learned it won the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120619234105/http://bop.nppa.org:80/2006/still_photography/winners/INS/63710/124345.html">Best of Photo Journalism Award</a> for 2006. The picture says it all, but the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070609175343/http://www.msnbc.msn.com:80/id/7245228/site/newsweek/">story</a> is just as harrowing. What a sad mess.</p>
