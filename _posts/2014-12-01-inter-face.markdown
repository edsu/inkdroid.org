<blockquote><p>
Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document">document</a>, every moment in every document, conceals (or reveals) an indeterminate set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interfaces</a> that open into alternate spaces and temporal relations.</p>
<p>Traditional criticism will engage this kind of radiant textuality more as a problem of context than a problem of text, and we have no reason to fault that way of seeing the matter. But as the word itself suggests, "context" is a cognate of text, and not in any abstract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes">Barthesian</a> sense. We construct the poem's context, for example, by searching out the meanings marked in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism">physical witnesses</a> that bring the poem to us. We read those witnesses with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity">scrupulous</a> attention, that is to say, we make our detailed way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass">through the looking glass</a> of the book and thence to the endless reaches of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Library of Babel</a>, where every text is catalogued and multiple cross-referenced. In making the journey we are driven far out into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extragalactic_astronomy">deep space</a>, as we say these days, occupied by our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit">orbiting</a> texts. There objects pivot about many different points and poles, the objects themselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting">shapeshift</a> continually and the pivots move, drift, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering">shiver</a>, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry)">dissolve</a> away. Those transformations occur because "the text" is always a negotiated text, half perceived and half created by those who engage with it.</p>
