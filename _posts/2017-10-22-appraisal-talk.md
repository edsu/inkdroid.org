*This is a draft of a talk I'm giving at [SIGCIS](http://meetings.sigcis.org/conference-schedule.html) on October 29, 2017. It's part of a larger article that I will hopefully publish shortly or drop in a pre-print archive.*

As the World Wide Web has become a prominent, if not the predominant, form of
global communications and publishing over the last 25 years we have seen the
emergence of web archiving as an increasingly important activity. The web is an
immensely large and constantly changing information landscape that fundamentally
resists the idea of "archiving it all" [@Masanes:2006]. The web is also a site
for constant breakdown in the form of broken links, failed business models,
unsustainable infrastructure, obsolescence and general neglect. Web archiving
projects work in varying measures to stem this tide of loss--to save what is
deemed worth saving before it is 404 Not Found. In many ways you can think of
web archiving as a form of repair or maintenance work that is conducted by
archivists in collaboration with each other, as well as tools and
infrastructures [@Graham:2007 ; @Jackson:2014].

In this presentation I will describe some research I've been doing into how web
archives are assembled and why I think this matters for historians of
technology. What follows is essentially what [@Brugger:2012a] calls a *web
historiography* where the focus is on the web as a particular technology of
history rather than a particular history of web technology. The web, and by
extension, web archives provide a singular view of life and culture since its
inception 25 years ago. Understanding how and why web archives are assembled is
an important task for the scholars who are attempting to use them
[@Maemura:2016]. As we will see, it is the network of relationships and
connections that a web archive is involved with that make it an archive.

By *web archives* I specifically mean archives *of* web content, not necessarily
archives that are *on* the web. BrÃ¼gger distinguishes between three types of
content that can be found on the web:

* *digitized*: content that has been converted to digital format by some means (image scanning, transcription, etc) and then placed on the web.
* *born-digital*: content that is created digital (word processor files, blog posts, social media, digital photographs, etc) and can be naturally found on the web.
* *reborn-digital*: is *digitized* or *born-digital* content that has been collected and preserved from the web, and then re-presented as part of a web archive.

It is this third category of *reborn-digital* content that I'm concerned with
here. A prime example is the Internet Archive, which I imagine some of you have
used as a source of material in your own research. There are now thousands of
organizations around the world collecting web content for a variety of archival
purposes.

The question of *what* and *how* web content ends up in an archive is of
[historiographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography) significance,
because history is necessarily shaped by the evidence of the past that survives
into the present. Since it is physically impossible to archive everything,
archives have always contained gaps or silences. @Trouillot:1995 provides a
framework for thinking about these moments in which these silences enter the
archive:

> Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments:
> the moment of fact creation (the making of sources): *the moment of fact
> assembly (the making of archives)*; the moment of fact retrieval (the making
> of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making
> of history in the final instance).

Given the significance of the making of archives to the making of history, and
the abundance of material on the web, how do archivists decide what to save?

Archivists have traditionally used the term *appraisal* to describe the process
of determining the value of records, in order to justify their inclusion into
the archive. While notions of value, and the methods for measuring it differ,
the activity of appraisal is central to the work of the archivist. To further
specify this moment in which content becomes archival @Ketelaar:2001 introduced
the neologism *archivalization* as

> the conscious or unconscious choice (determined by social and
> cultural factors) to consider something worth archiving. Archivalization
> precedes archiving. The searchlight of archivalization has to sweep the
> world for something to light up in the archival sense, before we can
> proceed to register, to record, to inscribe it, in short  before we
> archive it.

In order to better understand this process of *lighting up* web content in web
archives I conducted 30 interviews with web archivists, software developers,
researchers and activists to discover how they decide to preserve web content.
Inspired by the work of @Suchman:1995, @Star:1999 and @Kelty:2008 these were
[ethnographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography) interviews that aimed
to develop a thick description of how practitioners enact appraisal in their
particular work environments.

In the first pass at analysis I coded the jottings and field notes generated.
These provided a detailed picture of the sociotechnical environment in which
appraisal work is being performed [@Summers:2017]. However questions still
remained about the particular psychological or social context for the decision
making process around moments of archivalization in web archives.

On a second pass I performed a [critical discourse
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis) on the
interview transcripts themselves. I selected critical discourse analysis (CDA)
because it offers a theoretical framework for analyzing the way in which
participants' use of language reflects identity formation, figured worlds and
communities of practice, while also speaking to the larger sociocultural context
that web archiving work is taking place within.

> A Discourse is a socially accepted association among ways of using
> language, of thinking, feeling, believing, valuing, and of acting that
> can be used to identify oneself as a member of a socially meaningful
> group or 'social network', or to signal (that one is playing) a socially
> meaningful 'role'. [@Gee:2015, p. 143]

CDA provides a theoretical framework for empirically studying the way that form
and function operate in language, and how this analysis can provide insight into
social practices. One of CDA's key proponents is James Gee, whose 7 building
tasks provided me with a guide for analyzing my interview transcripts to gain
insight into practices of appraisal in web archives [@Gee:2014a]. The 7 building
tasks include:

* *Significance*: how is language used to foreground and background certain
  things?
* *Activities*: how is language being used to enact particular activities?
* *Identity*: how is language being used to position specific identities and
  make them recognizable?
* *Relationships*: what relationships are signaled in the use of language?
* *Politics*: how are notions of of value and norms established in the use of
  language?
* *Connections*: how is language used to connect and disconnect ideas,
  activities,
  objects?
* *Sign systems and knowledge*: how does language position (privilege or
  disprivilege) particular sign systems, or ways of knowing and believing?

There's not enough time for me to get into all the details of my findings here,
but I would like to share a brief look at what this analysis looks like as a way
of introducing my key findings. All the names used in the transcriptions are
pseudonyms in order to allow the participants to be themselves as much as
possible.

Here I am interviewing Jim, who works at a non-profit web archiving
organization. I selected this snippet because it highlights how discourse
reflects the *relationships* that are involved in the appraisal process. Just
before this snippet Jim is talking about how he wasn't sure whether a particular
video streaming site could be archived because of the amount of data involved.
He sought the advice of his immediate supervisor Ariana, who then brought in
Alex, who is the Director of the archive. It turned out that the Director had a
connection with a staff person who was working at the video streaming company,
who could provide key information about the amount of data that needed to be
archived. Here Jim is using the hierarchical, chain-of-command relationships to
lend weight and formality to what is actually a much richer set of circular
relationships within the organization. The relationships also extended outside
the archive and into the organization that had created the video content.

We see this pattern reflected in another interview with Jack, who is an archivist at a large university, who has been working to document the activities of the fracking industry within his state.

Here Jack is explicitly describing "connections" or relationships as an
essential part of his job as an archivist. Just before this snippet he had
finished describing how he got the idea to document fracking from a web
archivist at another institution, who was already engaged in documenting
fracking in his tate. Jack's interest in documenting environmental issues had
developed while working with a mentor at a previous university. Jack wanted to
collaborate with this archivist to better document fracking activity as it
extends across geopolitical boundaries. He sought the approval from the
Associate Dean of the Library who was very supportive of the idea. However as
this snippet illustrates Jack sees these professional relationships as necessary
but not sufficient for doing the work.  He sees dialogue with the communities
being documented, in this case activist communities, as an important dimension
to the work of web archiving.

In addition to focusing on relationships Gee's Making Strange Tool is a
discourse analysis technique for foregrounding what might otherwise slip into
the background:

> In any communication, listeners/readers should try to act as if they
> were outsiders.

The use of *crawling and selecting* on line 2 is a phrase that Jack uses several
times in the interview. *Crawling* refers to the behavior of software used to
collect content from the web. The software that is used to do this is
originally referred to as a *web spider* because of the way it automatically and
recursively follows links in web content for some period of time. But web spiders need to be told by a person where to begin *crawling*, which
is the process of *selection*.

If you are thinking that selection and appraisal sound similar that's because
they are practically synonyms for each other. Both terms are concerned with
identifying material that is of enduring value for preservation in an archive.
*Appraisal* speaks to the theory, method or framework that is used for
performing the activity of *selection*.

In physical archives, boxes of paper manuscripts, files, diskettes or hard
drives change hands. A retiring researcher donates their personal papers or
workstation to an archive. Or a particular business unit transfers a set of
material to an archive according to a previously agreed upon record retention
program. In either case a relationship between the record creator or owner and
the archive is established. This relationship is intrinsic to the appraisal
process.

But in web archives this material transaction is not necessary or it is
transformed almost beyond recognition. The architecture and infrastructure of
the web, as well as the underlying Internet, allow content to be instantly
retrieved across vast distances. You only need to know the URL for the resource
and to instruct your web client (be it a browser or a *crawler*) to retrieve it.
When it is all working. As noted by @Brugger:2012b the reliability of archived
copies of web content is not a given. Features of the HTTP protocol, such as
cookies [@Barth:2011] and caching [@Fielding:2014] combined with the rendering
capabilities of the client software mean that the idea of a single idealized,
canonical representation of a web resource retreats from view. This seeming
immateriality of web content is an illusion generated by the very real
assemblage of physical networks, computing machinery, storage devices,
electrical grids and cooling units that must operate in concert to deliver
access.

As we saw with Jack, there is no need to enter into a conversation with a
website owner to start archiving web content. When the content is on the web an
archivist can start the archiving software, give it a URL, configure the
crawling behavior (how far, how long, how much, etc) and let it do its work. The
decision of what to crawl is detached from the relationships that have
traditionally guided appraisal. But like a ghost limb, Jack still felt the
significance of these connections between the archive and the content creators
for doing archival work. He wanted to establish them, even if they were not
technically necessary. The links of relationships between people have
effectively been replaced by hypertext links that provide discoverability and
access.

In many ways what this analysis seems to point to is an evolving practice of web
archiving where traditional concepts of appraisal are being unbracketed from one
context and reapplied in another. Focusing on the objects, be they paper files,
boxes, or representations of HTTP transactions, is less at issue than the
practices that involve those objects, and their network of interactions. This
shift in attention recalls the work of ethnographer and philosopher Annemarie
Mol, whose work studying the treatment of atherosclerosis highlights the
importance of practice:

> It is possible to refrain from understanding objects as the central focus
> of different people's perspectives. It is possible to understand them
> instead as things manipulated in *practices*. If we do this--if instead of
> bracketing the practices in which objects are handled we foreground
> them--this has far reaching effects. Reality multiplies. [@Mol:2002, p. 5]

The web archive is situated among these multiple record realities involving the
creators of records with the preservers of records with the users of records.

But to return to the question I started with: what does all this tell us about
how content is appraised for websites, and historiography of the web? I think
these brief examples highlight just how important it is to maintain the manifold
of relationships between record creators and the archive. Appraisal, as it is
embodied in the practices of archivists, and encoded into software tools, is a
social enterprise that shapes the historical record. Just as the infrastructure
of the web enables communication across great geographic distances, it also
simultaneously moves to obscure the relationship between the archive and the
archived. Further research is needed to discover practices that help bridge this
gap and make it legible, while allowing for new conceptions of appraisal to
develop and be translated.

If you're a scholar who uses archives of web content I encourage you to reach
out to the archivists you know, and to work with them to help build these
practices and ensure that they are collecting the things you value.  If you work
as part of an organization and want to ensure that your web content is being
collected and archives try reaching out to an archivist to let them know of your
interest. And of course if you are an archivist, and you are stymied by thinking
about archiving web content, there are good reasons for that. The web is a big
place, and its hard to know what to collect. Focusing on the relationships you
have with the communities you document can help make it more manageable and
meaningful.
