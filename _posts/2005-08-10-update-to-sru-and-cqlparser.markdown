<p>If you are tracking it you might be interested to know that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111008014054/http://use.perl.org:80/~LTjake/journal/">Brian Cassidy</a> added a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060924104603/http://search.cpan.org/dist/SRU/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/SRU.pm">Catalyst plugin</a> to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SRU/">SRU</a> CPAN module. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/">Catalyst</a> is a MVC framework that is getting quite a bit of mindshare in the Perl community (at least the small subset I hang out with in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a>). And if that wasn't enough Brian also committed some changes to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CQL-Parser/">CQL::Parser</a> that provides toLucene() functionality for converting CQL queries to queries that can be passed off to Lucene. Thanks Brian!</p>
