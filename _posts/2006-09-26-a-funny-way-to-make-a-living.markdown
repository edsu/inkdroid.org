<p>gabe discovered that the <a href="http://code4lib.org">code4lib.org</a> drupal instance was littered with comment spam. Someone had actually registered for an account and proceeded to add comments to virtually every story. </p>
<p>Since there was an email address associated with the account I figured I'd send an email letting them know their account was going to be zapped.</p>

Excuse me. Why are you posting spam to my drupal 
site? Consider your account removed.
