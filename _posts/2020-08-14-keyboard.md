I purchased a $20 [foldable bluetooth
keyboard](https://www.desertcart.us/products/177891982-mini-bluetooth-keyboard-mini-wireless-foldable-keyboard-usb-rechargeable-bluetooth-keyboard-portable-pocket-size-compatible-with-mac-i-os-windows-android-smartphones-tablets-laptops-and-more)
so that I can wade into text with all ten fingers instead of my just my thumbs.
I spent last month doing *a lot* of writing, and was surprised by how much of it
I did on my phone when an idea came to me, rather than at my desk with my
laptop. The keyboard is as small as my phone, but I'm not sure I'll remember to
bring it places where I would need it. We'll see how it goes.
