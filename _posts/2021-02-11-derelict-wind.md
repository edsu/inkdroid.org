The second Trump impeachment is underway. As expected the
tweets-seen-by-millions-that-are-no-longer-available are being used as
exhibits. For example here is one I saw in [this NYTimes
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-takeaways-day-2.html).

You can actually see this tweet being shown in the C-SPAN footage on YouTube
here:

You probably can notice that the text is the same, but it doesn't really look
like the original. For example You can see one version of what it looked like
at twitter.com here in the Internet Archive:

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107001513/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1342821189077622792">

I [still think it's a shame](https://inkdroid.org/2021/01/21/trumps-tweets/)
that Twitter have removed these utterances from public consciousness. As much
as I welcome that Twitter has finally stopped Trump from posting and
retweeting, we should have a record of what he said, when he said it, on the
web where it was published...especially now. And it's not just about this or
that tweet but looking at them together, and seeing the vile, shallow
unpresidential behavior in time, as a read-only archive. On. The. Web.

Or, I guess we'll have to rely on the [Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter
Library: The Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5W2jtDXDu4) until NARA puts
*something* online in 5 years.
