> Real freedom is not to feel limited when wearing this Zen robe, this

> composure in this busy life.

> Dogen Zenji says to be like a boatman. Although he is carried by the boat, he
> is also handling the boat. That is how we live in this world. Even though you 
> understand how to live in the world like a boatman, that does not mean you 
> are able to do it. It is very difficult, which is why you practice zazen.
