These are some *rough* notes for a virtual event that University College London
Department of Information Studies hosted on [Participatory Archiving and
Digital
Memory](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/digitization-and-the-future-of-archives-network-meeting-iii-tickets-163989185067).
I woke up at 3:30AM to attend, so I apologize in advance for the sketchiness of
what follows ðŸ˜´ â˜• â˜• â˜• 

### Data Cultures: Implications for Digital Equity and Archival Practice / Gillian Oliver

[Gillian Oliver] got things started by focusing attention on the importance of
"data cultures". As an example of data cultures she pointed to how the idea of
data privacy can be seen through notions of [collectivism] or the continuum
between *I* and *Us*. In some of her research she has looked at how shared use
of cell phone technology in Bangladesh happens despite the fact that the
devices themselves are designed for individual use by (Ayn Rand inspired)
Silicon Valley. She cited two of her works that are available for more
information on data cultures:

* [Recordkeeping Informatics for a Networked Age] by Frank Upward, Barbara Reed, Gillian Oliver, Joanne Evans.
* [Recordkeeping Cultures] By Gillian Oliver, Fiorella Foscarini. Facet Publishing. 

She emphasized the first because it is open access, and also authored by Frank
Upward who just died last week :(

There was a brief discussion afterwards about the differences between talking
about data, information and records. It seems to me this kind of tension is
pretty important to address for archival research programs. A participant
suggested that record keeping perspectives are a form of expertise, and that
all academic disciplines have their forms of expertise. I wondered about the
connection between "data cultures" and fields like [critical data studies].

### New Technologies, Crowdsourcing and Online User Participation in Archives / Alexandra Eveleigh

[Alexandra Eveleigh] works at [Wellcome Trust] and has been working at the
intersection between participatory archives and archives. She gave an overview
of the idea of participation in archives, and how the social web, or web 2.0
perspectives/technologies impacted archives. Terms like "crowdsourcing",
"archives 2.0", "participatory archives" are slippery. Much work has ended up
being facilitated in part through social media. Eveleigh put this XKCD cartoon
alongside her timeline to emphasize how much early thinking about participation
has been understood through our evolving conceptions about social media
platforms, that are themselves fragmented territories.

Early on @Palmer:2009 emphasizes that discussion needs to be focused on
benefits, who will benefit and how, rather than on tools themselves. More
recent thoughts about crowdsourcing can be found in
the new [Collective Wisdom: Perspectives on Crowdsourcing in
Cultural Heritage] which was itself written using a collaborative process as
a [book sprint].

Projects tend to focus on artifactual outputs: number of pages transcribed,
etc. But there has been a shift towards understanding participatory archives in
terms of people and communities. Participation isn't just about adding user
generated content, or transcribing ... we should be talking about building
trust and generating new knowledge, and stimulate critical reflection on record
keeping. How we work together (process) is more important than what we are
working on. People engage for different reasons, and engagement during the
pandemic [has exploded] in projects like the Smithsonian's Transcription
program.

Participatory strategies need to focus on collaboration and "reciprocal
curation" such as [LocalContexts]. Processes involving communities are equally
important to the outcomes. Participation need to be ethical and equitable. This
reminds me a lot of what we are trying to do in Documenting the Now with Social
Humans labels ... to give agency to social media users to shape how their data
can be made part of an archive. 

10 years ago it was acceptable to ask people to transcribe, today this is
usually performed by OCR technology. Although it is increasingly common for
people to be involved in the evaluation of algorithmic outputs. Just because
a task can be automated does not mean it should be. If not carefully applied AI
techniques can introduce subtle biases that alienate particular communities. 

Early principles for participatory archives can be seen as having shifted:

1. Decentralization Curation -> Agile and Adaptable
2. Radical User Orientation -> Respectful and Responsive
3. Contextualization of Records and the entire archival process -> Sustainable and Accessible

There's a temptation to talk about "projects". But the idea of a project is at
odds with the idea of participation.  Seeing participation as a one-off, or
add-on doesn't help organizations build participatory archival processes.
Participation requires organizational commitment. Respecting the labor of
participants by sustaining the work and ensuring accessibility are important.

There was a good question about *who* gets to decide what is participatory.
Alexandra thought that a decade ago it was the archivist who decided. But today
more mature projects allow participants to decide, this is why agile processes
are important, because things are learned during the participation.

I asked about how the goals of open access are sometimes at odds with important
archival work that needs to be done. Institutions like Wellcome have a clear
public mission. Alexandra responded saying that people should check out the
[CARE Principles] which should be read in response or in relation to the open
science focused [FAIR Principles]. Here CARE focuses on:

* Collective Benefit
* Authority to Control
* Reponsibility
* Ethics

### A shifting archival paradigm: Counter-archiving as a collaborative, community-led and participatory endeavour / Andrew Flinn

[Andrew Flinn] started by talking about different paradigms for participation:

* @Cook:2013 : Community
* @Caswell:2021 : Praxis
* @Kashmere:2010 ; @Ben-David:2020 : Contesting what knowledge is

When talking about participation Flinn notes that it's important to recognize
the work of [Sven Lindqvist] [Dig Where You Stand], on the significance of
documenting *your own* history.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Lindqvist"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 250px" src="/images/sven-lindqvist.jpg"></a>

The Swedish connection is interesting, especially (for me) thinking about the
impact that [participatory design] has made in digital work. Of course
I thought about how social media offers a way for people to document their own
lives in ways that are constrained (and exploited) by the social media
platforms themselves.

Flinn gave a series of examples of different community focused archives that
embody participatory ideas. I couldn't really note all of these down, although
many were familiar to me (perhaps because I've seen Flinn speak before). One
new one to me was the [MayDay Rooms] which is an example of the
counter-archive, run by activist communities to document their own activities.
The archive is a *social resource* rather than a *repository*.

He mentioned the work of the Documenting the Now (which was great) while
citing Caswell:

<a href="/images/participatory-archives-02.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/participatory-archives-02.png"></a>

Flinn notes that it's not an either-or between the past and the now. He points
towards ideas of [salvage] and challenging absence. This gets seen in the types
of material that are valued. Things that are ephemeral sometimes are devalued:
handbills, flyers, posters, programmes, are sometimes the only surviving
records. 

It was awesome to hear Flinn cite Anat Ben-David's work, which I was familiar
with from the web archiving connection.

Sometimes copyright frameworks constrain the type of participation that
archives need to do. [Witness] are a good example of applying evidentiary
practices from archives, but for witnesses of violence. Similar to the work of
the [Syrian Archive]. Counter archives are often personal and affective. Their
records are preserved from the threat of deletion and are not removed from the
context of their creation. They useful for building solidarity.

<a href="/images/participatory-archives-03.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/participatory-archives-03.png"></a>

Flinn noted in the discussion period that despite their colonial history
archival institutions can be led in the right direction and can be allies.
Relationships between community archives and institutions can be important for
sustainability of some records. Institutions have a huge role to play when it
comes to national narratives. There is a struggle within institutions about
these narratives. Equitable partnerships should be pursued, and attention to
how funding is distributed is critically important. Funding tends to be focused
on *projects* which are time based, and go to the institution rather than the
community. How can we move to more sustainable models that better recognize
community expertise and community labor. Also we need to reflect on who we fund
and who we don't fund. 

He cited dissertation work by Hannah Ishmael on [The Development of Black-Led
Archives in London] which I want to check out. Elizabeth Shepherd during the
Q&A noted that there is quite a bit of similarity between [community
informatics] and the types of counter-archives that Flinn was talking about.
Flinn agreed, and that much of this work is happening at Monash where Gillian
Oliver is from.

He was asked also whether the role of the digital has much to do with
counter-archives. Flinn noted that counter-archives are often hybrid, the
digital content starts as informal documentation which shifts into a more
archival/documentary mode. The role of *platforms*, whether people can get
their content out of the platforms again, and share it in a sustainable way are
a big concern.

Someone asked a question about how to find out about activist archiving. Flinn
noted that many of these efforts are specialized and localized. If you are
interested in the role of web documents in activism work I encourage you to
join the [Documenting the Now Slack](https://bit.ly/docnow-slack). We want it
to be bigger than just a discussion of Twitter, and welcome participation from
all different perspectives.
