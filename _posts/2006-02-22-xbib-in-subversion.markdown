<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080517164303/http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/">Bruce D'Arcus</a> has started putting his <a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/">XBib project</a> into <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/xbiblio/">subversion</a> at sourceforge. The code is going to include ruby, python and styling libraries. I didn't realize that sourceforge was offering up svn now...which is a welcome change. I want to set aside some time to get familiar with Bruce's model and code.</p>
