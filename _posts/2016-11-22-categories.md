Over on the [ORG] discussion list I got clued in to this debate between [Lucy
Suchman] and [Terry Winograd] that played out in the CSCW scene in the early
90s. Their debate centers on the use of of categories in [The Coordinator]
communication tool or software pattern for messaging in organizations that is
described in @Winograd:1986.

These are two towering figures in the field of design and human-computer
interaction. I read @Winograd:1986 a few years ago, and found much to like in
it--particularly its use of the idea of breakdown from Heidegger as a way to
understand the world. I came to Suchman fairly recently via my interest in
repair, and have found her sociomaterial approach as an anthropologist to be
really refreshing...even 30 years after @Suchman:1986. It's interesting that
both of these books came out in the same year, and played a big part in ushering
in the field of human-computer interaction. It turns out that they are also
friends, which I only learned in the last paragraph of the last article in the
debate.

In the first article Suchman has a bone to pick about the way in which
categories embedded within The Coordinator pattern express managerial politics
in an unreflective or unconscious way.

> ... systems of categorization are ordering devices, used to discipline the 
> persons, settings, events or activities by whom they are employed or to
> which they refer. Non-compliance with the use of a particular category 
> scheme, particularly one imposed from the outside, or the adoption of an
> alternative are in this sense acts of resistance.

What's really going on here is a critique of [speech act] theory to model
conversations to inform the design of computer systems. Suchman isn't ultimately
saying that such modeling techniques aren't useful, but that as they are encoded
into computer systems they are embedding politics, and that it is imperative on
us as the designers of these systems to reflect on those politics. It's
astonishing how we are still in this moment today.

In his response Winograd basically argues that Suchman is characterizing his
work in an overly negative light, and that the goal of The Coordinator is not to
build a generalized model for organizational communications, but to provide a
pragmatic framework for the design of computer systems:

> Suchman is absolutely correct in observing that no systematic account 
> can fully capture the richness of mental life or social interaction. In 
> spite of our extensive writing to the contrary [@Winograd:1986] she 
> mistakenly takes that to be the goal of our work. Flores and I work from 
> a practical rather than a disengaged analytical stance--the guiding
> question is not "How do you account for all of human behavior?" but 
> "How do you design to augment people's capacity to act?"

But Suchman's point still stands -- as we decide how to build these systems that
augment our ability to act, how do we determine what acts to augment?

> The important point is that wherever we find systems of categorization
> we should look to see where they come from, and what work they are doing 
> for whom.

and then later:

> My "hostility" then, is not to "the disciplinary power of category" but
> rather, as I stated earlier, to the premise that some others are in a 
> position to know better which categories are good for us as organizational
> members than we do ourselves.

It seems to me that this is an argument for [participatory design], where 
the users of computer systems are directly involved in a conscious way in the
design. It's so interesting to me after years of working as a software developer
that ideas such as [agile software development] have this long intellectual
history.

And this debate between Winograd and Suchman is still just as relevant 
today:
