<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110610010758/http://access2005.library.ualberta.ca:80/">Access</a> this year where lots of library developer types I respect and learn from were presenting and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080531162547/http://access2005.library.ualberta.ca:80/hackfest.php">hacking</a>. Fortunately the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080517040408/http://access2005.library.ualberta.ca:80/presentations/">audio and slides</a> are now available. Combined with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071018163909/http://access2005.library.ualberta.ca:80/planetaccess/">collected blogging</a>  and snippets in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib">irc</a> I almost feel like I was there...but I imagine the real brain storming and fun happened outside of these artifacts. Inspiring stuff, and highly recommended if you're into writing software for libraries/archives.</p>
