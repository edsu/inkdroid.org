The Internet Archive does some amazing work in the Sisyphean task of archiving
the web. Of course the web is just too big and changes too often for them to
archive it all. But Internet Archive's crawling of the web and serving it up out
of their Wayback Machine, plus their [collaboration] with librarians and
archivists around the world make it a truly public service if there ever was
one.

Recently they [announced] that they are making (or thinking of making) a
significant change to the way they archive the web:

> A few months ago we stopped referring to robots.txt files on U.S. 
> government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying 
> web pages (though we respond to removal requests sent to info@archive.org). 
> As we have moved towards broader access it has not caused problems, which 
> we take as a good sign. We are now looking to do this more broadly.

The [robots.txt] was developed to establish a conversation between
web publishers and the [crawlers], a.k.a. bots, that come to gather and index
content. It allows web publishers to provide guidance to automated agents from
companies like Google about what parts of the site to index, and to point to a
[sitemap] that lets them do their job more efficiently. It also allows the web
publisher to ask a crawler to slow down with the Crawl-delay directive, if their
infrastructure doesn't support rapid crawling.

Up until now the Internet Archive have used the robots.txt in two ways: 

* their [ia_archiver] web crawler consults a publisher's robots.txt to determine
  what parts of a website to archive and how often
* the [Wayback Machine] (the view of the archive) consults the robots.txt
  to determine what to allow people to view from the archived content it has
  collected.

If the Internet Archive's blog post is read at face value it seems like they are
going to stop doing these things altogether, not just for government websites,
but for the entire web. While [conversation] in Twitter makes it seem like this
is a great idea whose time has come, I think this would be a step backwards for
the web and for its most preeminent archive, and I hope they will reconsider or
take this as an opportunity for a wider discussion.

I think it's crucial to look at the robots.txt as an imperfect, but much needed
part of a conversation between web publishers and archives of the web. The idea
that there is a perfect archive that contains *all the things* is a noble goal,
but it has always been a fantasy. Like all archives the Internet Archive
represents only a [sliver of a sliver] of the thing we call the web. They make
all kinds of decisions about what to archive and when, which are black boxed and
difficult to communicate. While some people view the [robots.txt] as nothing
better than a [suicide note] that poorly optimized websites rely on, robots.txt
is really just small toehold in providing transparency about the decisions about
what to archive from the web.

If a website really wants to block the Internet Archive it can still do so by
limiting access by IP addresses or by ignoring any clients named ia_archiver.
If the Internet Archive starts to ignore robots.txt it pushes the decisions
about who and what to archive down into the unseen parts of web infrastuctures.
It introduces more uncertainty, and reduces transparency. It starts an arms race
between the archive and the sites that do not want their content to be archived.
It treats the web as one big public information space, and ignores the more
complicated reality that there is a continuum between public and private. The
idea that Internet Archive is simply a [public good] obscures the fact that
ia_archiver is run by a [subsidiary] of Amazon, who sell the data, and also make
it available to the Internet Archive through a special arrangement. This is a
complicated situation and not about a simple technical fix.

The work and craft of archives is one that respects the rights of content
creators and involves them in the process of preservation. Saving things for the
long term is an important task that shapes what we know of the past and by
extension our culture, history and [future]. While this process has historically
privileged [the powerful] in society, the web has has lowered the barrier to
publishing information, and offers us a real opportunity to transform whose
voices are present in the archive. While it makes sense to hold our government
to a particular standard, not all web publishers are so powerful. It is
important that Internet Archive not abandon the idea of a contract between web
publishers and the archive.

We don't know what the fate of the Internet Archive will be.  Perhaps some day
it will decide to sell its trove of content to a private company and closes its
doors. That's why its important that we not throw the rights of content creators
under the bus, and hold the Internet Archive accountable as well. We need web
archives that are partners with web publishers. We need web publishers who take
their own archives seriously. We need more nuance, understanding and craft in
the way we talk about and enact archiving the web. I think archivists and
Archive-It subscribers need to step up and talk more about this. Props to the
Internet Archive for starting the conversation.
