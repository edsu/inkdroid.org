I like [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/)'s [idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTaeVVAvk-c) that the web isn't just a place for big corporations. It's a place where we can try new things, and support others that are doing work that helps and inspires us.

The early web was marked by a lot of idealism, which has turned out to have been way off the mark given the degree to which we are exploited online. But not all the web is this way. We have more autonomy and agency than we think. We are able to experiment in ways that big tech can't. We can wire things together in ways that they won't, and talk about things that they won't, and focus on our communities and co-ops and unions in ways that they can't and won't. And we can choose to support the people we see building the web this way.

It's a simple idea, but worth watching the whole talk to fully understand this point she is making.

With that in mind, I thought it would be kind of fun to add a page to my website listing the people and projects I choose to financially support who work on the web. You can find it [here](/support/).

I was wondering, is there a way to markup the HTML to indicate that I support these projects?

The primary purpose is to communicate this list to other people, so there's not really a strong use case for marking it up so it could be understood by software. But I do like how tools like [StreetPass] can discover people in the Fediverse as you browse the web.

I suppose there's probably some way to cobble something together with [schema.org](https://schema.org) or [Microformats](https://microformats.org), but perhaps something a [well-known-URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI) for discovery would be helpful?
