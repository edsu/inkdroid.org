*This is a lightning talk proposal for [Chesapeake DH] that I'm putting here so
I don't lose it...*

**Abstract**

Static site technologies are extremely useful for building durable digital
humanities webites. However one of the challenges to this approach can be
enabling data curators to easily update content when the data actually needs to
change. In this lightning talk I will briefly describe our use of the [Gatsby]
static site generator in combination with [Airtable] to publish and curate data
for a community archive.

**Bio**

Ed Summers works as a software developer at the Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities, and is also a PhD candidate in the College of
Information Studies at the University of Maryland. He is interested in tools and
practices where archives meet the web, especially issues related to social media
and collective memory.
