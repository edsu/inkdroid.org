We welcomed a new dog into our house this weekend. Her name is Penny.

It's amazing to me how much the energy changes in our family with a dog around.
I still miss our Tim who died suddenly last year. But seeing Penny reminds me
of all the good times we had. I wish they could have met each other.

Here is Maeve's list of potential dog names. She was polling everyone to see
what their favorite names were. We ended up going with Penny because she is the
color of a penny, at least right now. We also liked the idea of having her full
name be [Penny Lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rB0pHI9fU).

Her litter name was Latte, which we debated keeping. Ruthie had a strong contingent of support (despite the poll numbers). But it looks like Penny stuck for now.
