I tried talking to Meta's [new](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/5/23293281/meta-ai-chatbot-blenderbot-3-web-access-research-safety) AI chatbot about archiving a web page:

It seemed to do well conversationally for a bit, but eventually went into limbo, never to return, as it appeared to be [phoning a friend](https://millionaire.fandom.com/wiki/Phone-a-Friend)?

It's important to note this from the Terms of Service before you start goofing around:

> I understand that chat conversations will be published publicly, and used for future research. Therefore, I agree not to mention any personal information in my conversations, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers.

It seems like names, addresses, emails and phone numbers probably aren't the only things you don't want to drop in there...
