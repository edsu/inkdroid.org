      Software Foundations Series
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Coq proof assistant.

The exposition is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers. No specific background in logic or programming languages is assumed, though a degree of mathematical maturity is helpful. A one-semester course can expect to cover Logical Foundations plus most of Programming Language Foundations or Verified Functional Algorithms, or selections from both.

  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Fighting Erasure: Digitizing Gaza's Genocide and the War on Lebanon is a comprehensive project launched on October 8, 2023 aimed at documenting and protecting indigenous land, built environments, archives, and heritage in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, as well as in South Lebanon and the surrounding areas. The project includes a series of advocacy, education, and capacity building activities, along with the critical work of archiving, preserving, and providing access to what may become one of the most thoroughly documented genocides and land colonization in history. We archive against genocide by documenting human rights violations and settlements expansion, as well as its cultural dimensions through heritage and archival erasure. We archive against genocide by using visualization techniques and new media to educate about the human toll of the violence. We archive against genocide by providing the knowledge, training, equipment, resources, and planning and coordination needed locally to build capacity, resilience, and networks for archival protection, land tenure documentation, and heritage preservation. We advocate to, and engage with, diverse publics and decision makers to promote the safeguarding of heritage and archives, the reclamation of colonized lands and return of displaced people.

      Free Gifts: Capitalism and the Politics of Nature
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Capitalism is typically treated as a force for relentless commodification. Yet it consistently fails to place value on vital aspects of the nonhuman world, whether carbon emissions or entire ecosystems. In Free Gifts, Alyssa Battistoni explores capitalism’s persistent failure to value nature, arguing that the key question is not the moral issue of why some kinds of nature shouldn’t be commodified, but the economic puzzle of why they haven’t been. To understand contemporary ecological problems from biodiversity collapse to climate change, she contends, we have to understand how some things come to have value under capitalism—and how others do not. To help us do so, Battistoni recovers and reinterprets the idea of the free gift of nature used by classical economic thinkers to describe what we gratuitously obtain from the natural world, and builds on Karl Marx’s critique of political economy to show how capitalism fundamentally treats nature as free for the taking. This novel theory of capitalism’s relationship to nature not only helps us understand contemporary ecological breakdown, but also casts capitalism’s own core dynamics in a new light.
