Hopefully this isn't perceived as me caving, but I'm trying to redirect my [ire] at the spread of genAI into learning how to *evaluate* genAI, especially when comparing it to existing non-genAI systems, but also between different genAI solutions (models, etc).

I don't consider myself a [doomer or a boomer], and see genAI as [normal technology] that needs to be evaluated as a technology. I know this is a broad area, that overlaps somewhat with how the models are themselves built (benchmarking), but if you have recommendations please [let me know]?
