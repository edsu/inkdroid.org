Following on from my reading of Russell's [Open Standards] I decided to read
Martha Lampland and Susan Leigh Star's [Standards and their Stories]. Star had a
huge influence on the establishment of infrastructure studies, and the
application of ethnographic methods to sociotechnical research generally. So
this book has been on my bucket list for a while. The book is a collection of
essays by Lampland, Star and others -- and it is interspersed with news material
that provide useful examples of how the standards operate. I found the
alternation between the more theoretical and the more mundane to be really
useful...since part of the message of the book was methodological, or how to go
about studying standards and their impacts. Discourse analysis and content
analysis are useful techniques when examining how standards are deployed, and
being able to analyze the news critically and imaginatively is something that
Lampland and Star really got me thinking about.

In my own research I'm generally interested in how standards operate as part of
a community of practice, but also specifically how software, especially widely
deployed software (like Archive-It) can function as a de facto standard. The
behaviors embedded in the code of the software become the limits or boundaries
of what is thinkable or possible. The interfaces that are tangled up with, and
expressive of, that code govern what can and cannot be done. Sometimes standards
are accepted as reality by some groups, while they are and subverted and worked
around by others who seek alternate futures. For example in some ways its
possible to look at web archiving practices and standards as *resisting* the
much larger body of web standards which define the architecture of thw web.

So I came to Standards and their Stories hoping to see if it could provide any
insight into the work of software studies. Of course I found more things to read
such as @Abbate:2000 (which sounds like a classic I should already be familiar
with), and @Slaton:2001. It also got me thinking that I need to spend some time
with Bettivia:2016 to see how she structures her dissertation to analyze the
development of OAIS.

In their introduction to the collection Lampland and Star present a set of
questions that are useful in study standards:

> and quantification. Using historical analysis, this may mean analyzing

> long life? How do standards developed in one context acquire a modular 
> character, enabling them to be moved around or to serve as templates for
> the development of other standards? (p. 15)

These are lots of useful questions for coming at standards from different
angles.  The focus here and elsewhere in the book on historical methods has much
in common with [Russell]'s work. It makes perfect sense that access to records
and documents of standardization processes, would be important for analyzing the
development and impact of standards. But nonetheless I was surprised by it for
some reason I couldn't quite put my finger on. Perhaps I was just pleased to see
the application of humanistic methods in the social sciences, since my own
project sits at the crossroads or hinterlands (as @Law:2004 calls them) of the
humanities, social sciences and information technology. Thinking of Law, these
questions also remind how much Star has in common with [Bruno Latour]'s, who she
worked with in the 1980s, and specifically the method/philosophy of [Actor
Network Theory] (ANT). The questions are made in the same spirit as Latour's
call to "follow the actors", where the actors aren't only people:

> Using a slogan from ANT, you have ‘to follow the actors themselves’, that 
> is try to catch up with their often wild innovations in order to learn from 
> them what the collective existence has become in their hands, which methods 
> they have elaborated to make it fit together, which accounts could best 
> define the new associations that they have been forced to establish.
> [@Latour:2005]

Another connection that was pleasing was how work on standards intersects with
that of [James Scott]. I spent a summer reading his [Seeing Like a State] which
was very formative for me early on in the PhD program. In particular the idea of
the role of *legibility*, how things are made legible, and for whom, and what
legibility entails for the communities and environments that are being rendered
legible. Elizabeth Dunn writes:

> What are standards, anyway? Artifacts? Practices? A mode of governance? In

> (p. 118)

Reading this made me wonder how standards can operate sometimes to
unintentionally (or intentionally) to push groups out of markets, as both
producers and consumers. For my own research it suggests questions of how
standardization of WARC could have operated to consolidate particular ideas and
architectures of the web archiving, while invalidating others. I'm thinking here
of Michigan's early web archiving using httrack and the California Digital
Libraries own homegrown web archiving infrastructure, both of which were retired
to use Internet Archive's Archive-It service. I don't think this was an
intentional market consolidation, but perhaps an end result of how we
conceptualize and standardized what constitutes a web archive. What are the
knowledges and practices that are lost when this happened?

Dunn reminded me of a significant (and useful) term from Scott, *oikodomi*:

> Although standards present themselves as *episteme*, as pure idea that 
> exists outside of particular places, standards need an *oikodomi*, a
> material context in which they are transformed into action and effect.
> Fully analyzing standards requires seeing them within specific 
> infrastructures and observing how they modify and are modified by particular
> physical environments. (p. 120)

As I'm researching infrastructures of web archiving I expect that the case
study, [multi-sited ethnography] and documentary analysis will be extremely
important methods for seeing where standards meet and merge with practice. Also,
it will also be good to reacquaint myself with how Scott theorizes and mobilizes
his idea of *oikodomi*.  I don't usually think Scott is often thought of as an
STS scholar, at least he's not in [this list]. Perhaps that's because of his
interest in politics?  But I'd argue that he really does have a great deal to
offer to the STS project, particularly because of interest in the goals and
effects of *legibility*.

One chapter that stood out for me was Millerand and Bowker's *Metadata
Standards*. Of course, Bowker was a frequent collaborator with Star -- and as
they were partners they had a deeply shared vision of the STS project.  How data
relate to standards is a super relevant topic for m own work with web archives.
The chapter covers how metadata standards were deployed for the preservation and
access of scientific data in the [Long Term Ecological Research Network]. They
focus on the deployment of the Environmental Metadata Language (EML) as way-in
to looking at how data sharing and use is functioning. In many ways this
discussion really prefigures some of today's discussions around [data science]:

> A central problem here is that the storage of, access to, and evaluation of
> the validity of data are extremely dependent on the ways in which the data
> have been collected, labeled, and stored. (p. 150)

One insight that I thought was particularly significant was that infrastructures
don’t obey single timelines or life cycles. There are different intersecting
time scales that depend on actors purposes.

> There is no linear narrative to be told: "The time of innovations depends 
> on the geometry of the actors, not on the calendar" [@Latour:1996, p. 80]. 
> In other words, we cannot track a single life cycle (development, deployment, 
> and death) but must pay attention to the diverse temporalities of the actors. 
> This perspective allows us to better grasp how the existence and even the
> reality of projects vary over time, in line with the engagement or
> disengagement of actors in the development of these projects or objects.
> (p. 151)

Their study relied on interviews and participant observation with different
people involved in the standard as well as document analysis of standards and
other documentation. Interestingly they focused on two different groups of
people: the creators of the EML standard and the enactors of the standard (the
people who implemented it). I kind of wish more was said about how they arrived
at this grouping and the methodology in general. One of the reasons I really
enjoy reading Law so much is because of how long he dwells (perhaps even to a
fault) on methods [@Law:2004]. For example, were there people that participated
in both groups? Since Latour is being referenced I was kind of curious if they
consider non-human actors: the environments being studied, the instruments, etc.
I think this does come out later as they discuss the significance of different
measures, and how many of scales of measurement were locally adapted for
particular types of data collection, that made them more difficult to aggregate
and share consistently. This idea again recalls Scott's *oikodomi* discussed
above.

This question of multiple timelines, and the resistance to a linear narrative
also reminded me of Records Continuum model [@McKemmish:2010] that looks at
archives in a pluralistic way that embraces the many forms that archive records
can take, and the times in which archival processes engage with them:

> The life-cycle concept has been useful in promoting a sense of order,
> a systematic approach, to the overall management of recorded information.
> However, strict adherence to its principles undermines any trend toward 
> greater cooperation and coordination of archivists and records managers. 
> It ignores the many ways in which the records management and archives 
> operations are interrelated, even intertwined. It may be convenient in 
> a large bureaucracy to attempt to clarify roles and responsibilities by
> delineating carefully the records management and archival functions.
> It may also be counterproductive. @Atherton:1985, p. 47.

In both cases attention is being paid to the actual movement of actors (be they
people, data or records) instead of projecting a particular model onto their
movements (e.g. a timeline or lifecycle model). This kind of empirical work
means attending to the details and differences as much as the patterns and
continuities. Getting back to Millerand and Bowker, the difference they see
between deployment and enactment of standards is that our stories of standards
often privilege the invention of the standard over its enactment [@Baker:2007].


One document that Millerand and Bowker study is the projects data dictionary.
They were able to look at its revision over time as a way of reconstructing the
various collaboration activities. I'm hoping that version control histories in
code repositories such as GitHub can be used in a similar way, as a record of
the enactment of software. This technique has something in common I think with
[Trace Ethnography] which was developed as a method for studying data
ecosystems/infrastructures [@Geiger:2011].

Use of enactment and thinking about the "staging" of the standard as a method
also seems to be a useful technique they develop in this chapter. Is it possible
to see how standards and tools operate as a play script in need of
interpretation? Connecting standards and data practices led the authors to
observe that ultimatey ontology matters:

> We slice the ontological pie the wrong way if we see software over here and
> organizational arrangements over there. Each standard in practice is made up
> of sets of technical specifications and organizational arrangements. As 
> @Latour:2005 reminds us in another context, the question is how to 
> distribute qualities between the two--what needs to be specified technically
> and what can be solved organizationally are open questions to which there
> is no one right answer. (p. 165)

The book ends with an appendix that contains a course plan for an Infrastructure
Studies class. It struck me then how relevant that would be for the UMD iSchool,
because of our proximity to Washington DC where so much thinking about
infrastructures and governance is centered. I think it would be useful for our
students to get exposure to these ideas around standards and infrastructure to
show how the mundane details of how they operate are actually quite interesting,
and super relevant for our work.
