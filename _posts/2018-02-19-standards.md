Following on from my reading of Russell's [Open Standards] I dove into Martha
Lampland and Susan Leigh Star's [Standards and their Stories]. If you have
wandered around in this blog/notebook much   you probably I'm a big fan of
Star's work

Apart from my general interest in how standards operate in a community of practice I’m also interested in how software, especially widely deployed software like Archive-It operates as a de facto standard. The interfaces govern what can and cannot be done, and are often accepted as reality and subverted or worked around by others who seek alternate futures.

Resistance to standards and software expressed in the activity of archiving the web (working against the architecture of the web).

Abbate, Inventing the Internet ; 
Slaton, The hidden lives of standards
Diss work on Europeana Data Model as standard.

Questions to ask of standards p. 15 para 2

Historical analysis is an important aspect to researching standards. Connection to the humanities.

Connection to Scott p. 118
Standards pushing people out of markets. Did WARC help to consolidate the web archiving marketplace: collapse of CDL.

Oikodomi - where standards meet the real world and are put to use. From Scott? p. 120

Standards for provenance of data are important for use p. 150 (ahead of the curve)

Infrastructures don’t obey single timelines or life cycles. There are different intersecting time scales that depend on actors purposes. p. 151

Importance of examining enactment as a method of analysis. Weick (1979) p. 152

Interviews and document analysis performed 154-155. Qualitative methods. Compressor the creators of the standard to the enactors of the standard (implementors). 

Deployment vs enactment p. 157 — Baker & Millerand (2007)

How does the WARC standard itself frame an idea of what web archiving is? What can the early days of web archiving at umich tell us?

Use of the evolution of the data dictionary as a means of collaboration and record of engagement with the standard.

Use of enactment and thinking about the “staging” of the standard as a method. Interpretation of a script to put on a play. The adjustments that need to be made and interpretive acts. p. 162

The EML standardization effort is a backdrop to the very real social changes that the work brought about in regards to collaborative shifts and opening up of professional spaces p. 165.

Also nice quote about “slicing the organizational pie” on p. 165

Connection to Mol’s work on ontology (last para on 165)

Bias in computer systems and standards p.  193 voting Friedman and Nissenbaum who went on to start Value Sensitive Design.

Dark side of standards: standards can have bad affects on quality and design/innovation (Monthoux, 1981).
