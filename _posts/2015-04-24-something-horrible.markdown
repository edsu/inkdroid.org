<blockquote>
<p>There is something horrible, something that makes one fear for civilization, in denunciations of class-differences and class struggles which proceed from a class in power, one that is seizing every means, even to a monopoly of moral ideals, to carry on its struggle for class-power.</p>
<p>
@Dewey:1957, p. 301.
