I was just testing a new release of [twarc] and was alerted to a [test failure]
from [Travis] that seems to point to a change in Twitter's API. I thought I
would quickly write it up because it seemed like an interesting bit of Twitter
API arcana, as well as an unexpected use of [black box testing] to detect
changes in social media platforms like Twitter. It also highlights (for me) the
benefit of sometimes being lazy and not using [mock objects] in automated tests. 

The specific test that is failing is [test_follow] which uses Twitter's [follow
streaming API request] to watch for tweets from a handful of major news
organizations like [\@guardian], [\@nytimes], [\@cnnbreak], etc. Once the test
gets a tweet it examines the JSON and simply verifies that it came from one of
the followed accounts. I added the test to make sure twarc was doing things 
correctly more than to test Twitter's API.

The weird thing is that the test has recently started to fail because
*sometimes* it gets back tweets that don't appear to be sent from any of the
followed accounts. The tweets don't even appear to be retweets or quotes of
those accounts either. As you can see from the JSON included at the bottom of
the [test failure] the tweet that is returned is a retweet from [\@Margaritin22]
(971990761) of a tweet by [\@nytimesbusiness] (1754641) but the test wasn't
following either of those users...but it was following [\@nytimes] (807095).

So it looks as if Twitter's follow API now has some (new?) logic that provides
[\@nytimesbusiness] tweets because I am following tweets from [\@nytimes].
Perhaps this is some new marketing feature that allows media outlets like the
New York Times to pay Twitter to bundle accounts together for promotional 
purposes? Or perhaps there is an algorithm at play that assumes that since I am
following [\@nytimes] I would be interested in [\@nytimesbusiness]?

The test has only been in use since December 2015 which really isn't too long
ago. Plus the tests normally only run when I'm actively developing twarc or when
I push to GitHub. So perhaps this behavior isn't new and it has just been
lucky that the test hasn't failed until now?

But this follow behavior feels a bit like some other changes that Twitter [has
made] to the timeline where tweets are suggested based on popularity. If anyone
has any insight into this please let me know. 

For the moment the test has stopped following [\@nytimes] and it appears to
be working again...at least for now. Here's a musical interlude since
you made this far:
