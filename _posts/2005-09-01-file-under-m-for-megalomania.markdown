<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/40076">Google Announces Plan To Destroy All Information It Can't Index</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Although Google executives are keeping many details about Google Purge under wraps, some analysts speculate that the categories of information Google will eventually index or destroy include handwritten correspondence, buried fossils, and private thoughts and feelings.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously, many a truth is said in jest. With the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050825.html">news</a> that Google is going to be selling another 4 billion dollars worth of shares it makes sense that they would be thinking of a purging program to balance out their binging. What are they going to do with 4 billion dollars? I can't even begin to imagine. It is frankly, a bit frightening, and seems like behavior one might read about in the <a href="http://www.psychologynet.org/dsm.html">DSM IV</a>.</p>
