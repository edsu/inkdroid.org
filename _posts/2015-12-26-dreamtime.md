A snippet from some winter break reading from @Morton:2013 about what he calls
*phasing* in his study of [Hyperobjects]:

> [Napangati]'s [Untitled 2011] is a phase of Dreamtime, a phasing painting 
> whose waves undulate like Hendrix's guitar. The painting itself forces me 
> to see higher and higher dimensions of itself, as if layers of phase space 
> were being superimposed on the  other layers. These layers appear deep, as 
> if I could reach my arms into them. They float in front of the picture 
> surface. They move. The painting holds me, spellbound. The painting looks 
> like a map or a plot in phase space, which is just what it is, in one sense: 
> a map of how women walked across some sand hills. Yet what appears to be a 
> map turns out to be a weapon. The painting emits spactime, emits an 
> aesthetic field. The painting is a unit, a quantum that executes a function. 
> It is a device, not just a map but also a tool, like a shaman's rattle or 
> a computer algorithm. The function of the painting seems to be to imprint 
> me with the bright red shadow of a hyperobject, the Australian Outback, 
> the Dreamtime, the long history of the Pintupi Nine, the Lost Tribe, some 
> of the last Neolithic humans on Earth. (p. 74-75)
