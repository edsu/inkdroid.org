I recently finished reading [Delete] by [Viktor Mayer-Schönberger] and thought I
would jot down some brief notes for my future self, since it is a significant
piece of work for my interests in web archiving. If you are interested in memory
and information and communication technologies (ICT) then this book is a must
read. Mayer-Schönberger is a professor at the [Oxford Internet Institute] where
he has focused on issues at the intersection of Internet studies and governance.
*Delete* is a particularly good tonic for the widespread idea that electronic
records are somehow fleeting, impermanent artifacts--a topic that
@Kirschenbaum:2008 explored so thoroughly a year earlier from a materialist
perspective.

*Delete* functions largely in two modes. The first (and primary) is to give an
overview of how our ideas of permanence have shifted with the wide availability
of computer storage and the Internet. The focus isn't so much on these
technologies themselves, but on the impact that storage capabilities and wide
distribution has had on privacy and more generally on our ability to think.
Mayer-Schönberger observes that for much of human history remembering has been
difficult and has required concerted effort (think *archival* work here). The
default was to forget information. But today's information technologies allow
the default to be set to remember, and it now requires effort to forget.

Examining the potential impacts upon cognition and our ability to think are
where this book shines brightest. If the default is set to remember how does
this shape public discourse? How will ever present and unlimited storage with a
surveillance culture work to cement self-censorship that will suppress free
expression and identity formation? The book contends that ICT allow Bentham's
[Panopticon] to be extended not only in space, but also in time, recalling
Orwell's popular quote, as used by [@Samuels:1986]:

> Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present 
> controls the past.

It is easy to see this mechanism at work in large social media companies like
Google and Facebook, where efforts to *delete* our data can get interpreted
instead as *deactivate*, which simply renders the content inaccessible to those
outside the corporate walls. The data that these companies collect is core to
their business, and extremely valuable. They often aren't deleting it, even when
we tell them to, and are incentivized not to. What's more the parties that the
data has been sold to, or otherwise shared with, probably aren't deleting it
either.

While it's true that computer storage has greatly enabled the storage of
information it has also, at the same time, accelerated our ability to generate
information. I feel like Mayer-Schönberger could have spent more time addressing
this side of the equation. There are huge costs associated with remembering at
the scales that Google, Facebook and other companies are working at. There are
also large costs associated with preserving information for the long term
[@Rosenthal:2012a]. Are large technology companies invested in saving data for
the long term? Or are they more oriented to extracting market value out of our
personal data while it is valuable as an predictive economic indicator.
Examples like Google's preservation of [Usenet] are in short supply. It is
important to think about now only how things are being remembered, but *who* is
doing the remembering. If it does become valuable to remember for the long term
then we face a situation when only very large organizations are able to do it,
which

This future where access to our past could be increasingly denied is a
disturbing thought indeed. It also foregrounds the importance of memory work as
a source of power and vehicle for social justice [@Jimerson:2009, @Punzalan:2016].

The second mode that *Delete* engages in is exploring possible responses to the
problem of deletion and memory in ICT. One of the more useful contributions that
Delete offers is a framework for thinking about the range of responses:

|               | Information Power (Privacy) | Cognition              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Individuals   | Digital abstinence          | Cognitive adjustment   | 
| Laws          | Privacy rights              | Information ecology    |
| Technology    | Privacy + DRM               | Full contextualization |

This framework largely operates to carve out the area of cognition as a new
territory for experimentation. *Delete* does do a nice job of talking about
privacy laws and digital rights management (DRM) systems. In particular
@Halderman:2004 is cited as an example of example of work on protocols for
informed consent that could hold promise. I think we have seen these play out
more recently in affordances of social media where for example in Facebook you
have the ability to control whether other people can tag you in photos. It is an
area we are looking to more fully develop in the [Documenting the Now] project.

But in general Meyer-Schönberger asserts that DRM and privacy rights tends to be
oriented around binary operations (rights, no rights) and when rights are
obtained the party can do whatever they want with the content. Power
differentials are also at work, where large powerful companies obtain rights
from the weaker individuals, who ultimately have little bargaining power.  Even
in countries that have privacy laws around personal data, there has been very
little exercise of them. This was back in 2009, and it would be interesting to
know if it's still the case.

At any rate, all of these solutions are examined but ultimately put aside for
some failing or another in order to promote the proposed solution which the book
has been leading up to: reintroducing forgetting. Specifically the last few
chapters make the case for adding controls into applications that let users
control how long content lives. You do get the feeling that this is the horse
that the book has been betting on since the beginning, and that other options
have been summarily dispatched to leave it as the only contender. But
Meyer-Schönberger's analysis of the other options is really quite convincing,
and is really meant to paint a full picture, not to invalidate the other
approaches.

The idea of an HCI approach to forgetting must have been quite novel at the
time, and I'd argue that it still is. We now see the ability to [delete your
account] from social media platforms like Facebook for example. [Snapchat] has
popularized the idea of [ephemerality] of personal data, which has been picked
up by Instagram in their [stories] feature, where content expires after 24
hours.  Instagram also offers an [archive function] which makes previous posts
only available to you and not to the public or those who follow you. It is
interesting to see these affordances being built into tools, and as far as I
know not much research has been done into why and how users are choosing to use
them. Also, it would be interesting to see how understandings of the deletion
match up to reality. If you have run across research (or are doing it yourself)
that has I'd love to hear from you.

The idea of expiration dates outlined in Delete is expressed as a negotiation
between parties that is reminiscent gift agreement in archives. This makes me
wonder if it could be useful to draw on the research literature around privacy
in archives [@MacNeil:1992] and the impacts of digitization on archival
preservation [@Iacovino:2007].

Which brings me to my last point, and one of the main drawbacks of *Delete*.
Unfortunately there is very little mention of the role of libraries and archives
throughout the book as memory institutions (p.  190). Really the only mention of
archives and libraries comes near the end when discussing the potential negative
impacts of expiration dates:

> ... expiration dates may be accused of impeding the work, and even calling 
> into question the very existence, of archives and libraries. This belief is
> unfounded. Expiration dates let individuals decide how long they want 
> information to be remembered. But societies have the power to override such

The book would have benefited from a look at record management processes, and
processes of appraisal which work to select material for long term preservation
and access.  In addition to expiration there is the related idea of content that
is embargoed for access until a certain time has passed. By what mechanisms
would society override an expiration date? And what of situations where powerful
institutions are able to override the archive [@George:2013]? 

One interesting idea that *Delete* mentions is the idea of digital versions of
"rusting" that mimics partial as well as gradual forgetting.

This discussion of "rusting" reminds me of the ways in which cards can appear to
[age] and are then [archived in Trello] or pictures are archived in Instagram.
It also recalls the ways in which tape archive systems function to keep
frequently used data in [nearline storage] which is a state in between online
(readily accessible) and archived (taking a long time to access). Amazon's
[Glacier] operates in a similar way to save the cost of keeping data by pushing
it offline into an archive.

This rusting could be methodically introduced into systems, for example it's
interesting to consider if the Library of Congress Twitter Archive were to be
made available only on site (not on the Internet) and queries took up to 24
hours to complete. While these limitations could be criticized as an access bug,
they could also serve as a rusting feature that operates as a limit or bounding
function for memory. I think it's possible to also look at the perceived
clunkiness and imperfection of accessing the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine
by URL, and the current lack of search, as a feature that allows this very
special archive to exist. A total-recall web archive (full coverage with search)
could present serious cultural and cognitive challenges to our concept of
memory, and the role of technology in mediating memories.

*Delete* is ultimately a call to do more research into the impacts of ICT on
memory, and explore new affordances for memory in our tools and pratices.

I'm about to embark on [more reading] about memory and technologies, so if you
have recommendations please [let me know]! As an aside I've started I've 
started tagging stuff I run across on the web with the [tag delete].

PS. *Delete* also teaches the value of a succinct and evocative title for your
work. It was fun using the book title interchangeably with the author's name, as
if the book had somehow become a persona or character, and take on a life of its
own.
