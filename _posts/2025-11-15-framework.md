> Just as paintings can be abstract, so can poems, or at least so can the way the language is used in a poem. It can be abstracted from the representational sense we are used to finding in syntactically grammatical concatenations of words, and fragmented or joined up in unpredictable ways. Unlike in abstract painting there is no absence of represented objects; instead there is an overlay or a plethora of possibilities: syntax that changes abruptly, ghosts of phrases or sentences, bits of rhyme, all shaped by and shaping mood and tone. In some ways, too, poems are like music, complex of sounds, cadences, rhythms nd silences. They are frameworks for thinking, and they themselves can tech you how to red them. People's readings will differ about nuance, emotional response, resonance and the poem's thinking, because readers differ in what they bring to the poem and therefore to some extent in what they take away from their encounter with it, but there will always be parameters of some kind or other to guide interpretation and offer limits to it. [@Patterson:2025, p. 191]

> You can like a poem straight away or, equally, dislike it straight away, but either way it's always helpful to find out why. Then, if possible, disregard that initial emotional response and concentrate on the poem itself, its mechanisms and meanings. And then when you're fairly clear about how the poem is doing whatever it is doing, and you have a sense of the way in which the time it was written shapes or limits its expressive possibilities, and perhaps a sense of the poem as something more complex, less clear-cut than it seemed at first, return to your original response and reassess it. You may feel the same way about it as you did to start off with, but now at least you should be able to give better reasons for it. [@Patterson:2025, p. 173]

There is much to relish in Ian Patterson's excursion into life with books, and all the sorts of configurations of books we call *libraries*. He has worked as an educator, bookseller, translator, and poet, which lends his book a cubist touch, appreciating books from many different angles but with a decidedly humanist perspective (which suits me fine). The two quotations above are from the chapter about poetry, which I thought was striking for its practicality. That probably makes it sound boring, but it is actually quite moving hearing how books figure into his life as a poet. Patterson gives poetry readers license to appreciate and generate their own meanings, rather than trying to decode *the* meaning--and encourages understanding how words and their structures operate on/with us.

The book follows along through different genres of books as he also talks about building his own library from the books that remain in his possession after leaving his home and work in Cambridge. The library is assembled in an old carriage house out back of his house. I suppose reading this book was a bit of inspiration for me to bring some books out of storage, and put up a few shelves in my work room, which became available after some reshuffling at home, as kids have grown up and moved out. It's not a ton of shelf space, but it's comforting to have these books nearby, like old friends.
