This morning I saw [a post](https://mastodon.hawaga.org.uk/@benc/109620512742247630) about how to create a Mastodon status update on the command line using [curl](https://curl.se/).

It got me thinking that it could be fun to add a little bit of script around it that allowed you to create the post in your configured \$EDITOR, kind of like how git will open your editor of choice when you make a commit.

I don't foresee wanting to read and reply to posts in the terminal (I would miss the images in the fediverse). But similar to my approach to [jounaling](https://inkdroid.org/2021/03/27/j/) I thought it might be useful to be able to quickly jot down a post, without getting sucked in to reading, necessarily.

Here's what it looks like in action:

<video width="700" controls>
  <source src="/videos/post.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

To try it out put this little script in your `PATH` (I called mine "post") and then set the environment variables (`EDITOR`, `MASTODON_POST_HOST`, `MASTODON_POST_TOKEN`) for it to use:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set these environment variables and you can create a (text-only) post using
# your favorite command line text editor.
#
# - EDITOR: e.g. vim, emacs, etc
# - MASTODON_POST_HOST: the hostname for our Mastodon account, e.g. chaos.social
# - MASTODON_POST_TOKEN: an app access key with write:statuses permission
#
# See: https://gist.github.com/edsu/aa6f70bb20127b1e18e05dff5e470022

if [[ -z "${EDITOR}" ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Please set EDITOR to something (e.g. vim, emacs) in your environment"
  exit
fi

if [[ -z "${MASTODON_POST_HOST}" ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Please set MASTODON_POST_HOST in your environment"
  exit
fi

if [[ -z "${MASTODON_POST_TOKEN}" ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Please set MASTODON_POST_TOKEN in your environment, get one by creating an app at https://$MASTODON_POST_HOST/settings/applications"
  exit
fi

post_dir=`mktemp -dt "mastodon-post.XXXXXXXXXX"`
post_file="$post_dir/post.txt"

$EDITOR $post_file

if [[ ! -f $post_file ]]; then
  echo "üõë cancelled posting..."
  exit
fi

curl --silent --header "Authorization: Bearer ${MASTODON_POST_TOKEN}" https://${MASTODON_POST_HOST}/api/v1/statuses --form "status=<${post_file}" > /dev/null

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "ü¶£ post sent!"
else
  echo "üòü post failed" 
fi
```

It's also available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/edsu/aa6f70bb20127b1e18e05dff5e470022) where it might see some updates. It's probably complicated enough to warrant being written in \$another_programming_language, but I know there are other fully functional terminal apps like [toot](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot) and [tut](https://tut.anv.nu/) for anything more complicated than sending off a quick post.
