  content: I forgot to add that we talked about 2G zip files too. So you can think
    of yourself as still here in spirit if that eases the pain. Assuming it's still
    possible to feel pain in Northern California :-)

  content: "Nothing \"lost\" about it.  It's Chapter VIII (excluding the first two
    paragraphs) of \"The Pavilion On The Links\", an 1880 short story which forms
    part of his 1882 collection <i>New Arabian Nights</i>.  The 1900 date given in
    the copy presumably refers to an American edition.\r\n\r\nI'll add to your collection
    of oddities that Finger, Gopher, and Whois are all basically the same protocol:
    write one line to the server, then read back an arbitrary amount of text until
    EOF.  You used to be able to talk to Finger servers using URLs of the form gopher://example.com:79/0&lt;username&gt;
    ."

    sound like I missed much of anything at all...\r\n\r\nAnd I wouldn't listen to
    a word Boyko says; he's got overexposure to that, uh, what do you call it, ah
    yes, \"sun\" thing."

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What do 100 year old knitting patterns and a lost Robert Louis-Stevenson story have in common?</em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A digitally preserved <a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/lccn/sn83030193/1904-02-19/ed-1/seq-15">newspaper page</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What about if you add:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>URIs for<a href="https://www.ravelry.com"> knitting materials</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William Blake</a>'s Engravings</li>
<li>The similarities/differences between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp">XMPP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http">HTTP</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nntp">NNTP</a></li>
<li>Web crawling as data integration</li>
<li>Project coordination with <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/semantic-web">rooms</a> on FriendFeed</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Just a typical lunch time conversation at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/petes-diner-washington">Pete's</a> with a <a href="http://davidbrunton.com">couple</a> <a href="http://eikeon.com">people</a> I work with. The cool thing (for me) is that this is normal, involves a host of smart/interesting characters, and is routinely encouraged. I love my job.</p>
