This is a little segment of [Sarah Manguso]'s Perfection [@Manguso:2020] that
spoke to me.  It made me laugh a little as I often struggle to recognize the
heart of a project--it's particular, sometimes obvious, always contingent,
truth.  The irony of using someone else's voice to demonstrate original voice is
not lost on me.  Citation be damned! Who do these words *really* belong to
anyway?  Aren't our bibliographies always simply a catalog of the words' last
foster parents or caretakers?

I guess the only bone I have to pick here is with the *refusal*, which implies a
conscious and deliberate choice not to let that voice in. As if it is known, and
not hidden in plain sight.
