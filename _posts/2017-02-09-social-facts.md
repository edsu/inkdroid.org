[\@congressedits](https://twitter.com/congressedits) turned up one of the more
interesting edits from the House of Representatives today:

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">United States Attorney General Wikipedia article edited anonymously from US House of Representatives <a href="https://t.co/qZAjzOKrHV">https://t.co/qZAjzOKrHV</a></p>&mdash; congress-edits (@congressedits) <a href="https://twitter.com/congressedits/status/829725567075352576">February 9, 2017</a></blockquote>
</div>

If you follow the link in the tweet and go and look at [the edit] you can see 
that this text was removed (emphasis mine):

> Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been nominated, as of January 2017, to
> succeed Loretta Lynch as the 84th Attorney General of the United States. Dana
> J. Boente of Virginia was appointed on January 30, 2017 to serve as acting
> Attorney General. ***The first acting Attorney General under President Trump –
> Sally Yates – was dismissed by Trump after Yates told justice department
> lawyers not to defend his executive order restricting entry for people from
> seven countries.*** Sessions was confirmed by the Senate on February 8, 2017.

In case you were wondering what the rationale for the edit was they boldly
stated:

<img alt="The circumstances surrounding Sessions' nomination and everything that happened with Yates is now irrlevant and doesn't belong." class="img-fluid center-block img-thumbnail" src="/images/sessions-comment1.png">

Then three minutes later another anonymous user reverted the 
change saying:

<img title="Reversing potentially politically charged edit made by someone within the US House of Representatives" class="img-fluid center-block img-thumbnail" src="/images/sessions-comment2.png">

The thing that I find interesting here is that the person who reverted the edit
clearly knew the user was accessing Wikipedia from the US House of
Representatives.

Now it's possible that they found out by some other means, but I think it's
likely that they found out from \@congressedits itself. Maybe someone else would
have noticed the edit independently, but it's significant how the provenance of
this edit mattered.

I think it's a great example of how social media can work to *establish and
maintain* facts rather than just be a mechanism for spreading alternate facts
and so called fake news.
