This is pretty niche but if you ever find your self wanting to download all the versions of a set of Wikipedia articles you might be interested in [wikipedia-revision-downloader](https://github.com/edsu/wikipedia-revision-downloader) a short program that queries the Wikipedia API for a set of pages in a text file, and will generate a JSON file for each revision.

For example if you have a file `urls.txt` that looks like:

```text
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Carl
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Moore_(Alabama_politician)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Alabama_politician)
```

You can run it:

```bash
$ python3 download.py urls.txt
```

which will create a directory structure something like this, where each article and revision gets a unique JSON file:

```

To understand the meaning of the JSON files you will need to consult the [Wikipedia API documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Brevisions) docs for the details. I created this for my friend [Ernesto Calvo](https://twitter.com/ecalvo68) who is studying how a set of articles about US politicians have been edited over time. No spoilers on the specific thing he's looking at :)
