Some (lighter) winter break reading from @Hagen:1977:

> Vitality consists of this birth and death. This impermanence,
> this constant arising and fading away, are the very things that
> make our lives vibrant, wonderful and alive.
>
> Yet we usually want to keep things from changing. We want to perserve things,
> to hold onto them. As we shall see, this desire to hold on, to somehow
> stop change in its tracks, is the greatest source of woe and horror
> and trouble in our lives. (p. 21)
