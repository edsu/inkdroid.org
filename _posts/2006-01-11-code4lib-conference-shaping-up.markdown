<p>The votes are in, and the a <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/2006/schedule">tentative schedule</a> is up. There were a remarkable amount of <a href="http://inkcow.backpackit.com/pub/354440">wonderful</a> presentation ideas submitted, and unfortunately there wasn't the time/space for all of them. Fortunately there will be lightning talks and breakout sessions that will hopefully pick up some of the slack.</p>
<p>The talks were voted on by anyone who planned on attending. That's right *anyone*. This was like a breath of fresh air for me. The voting mechanism was a genius javascript <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/2006/voting/start">hack</a> at the 11th hour by <a href="http://dilettantes.blogspot.com/">Ross Singer</a> which allowed drupal users on code4lib.org to annotate a <a href="http://inkcow.backpackit.com/pub/354440">backpack page</a>, which stored results in a database at gatech.edu. We even hooked up our resident bot in <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a> to be able to talk to the database and get up to the minute polling results. </p>
<p>Anyhow, things are looking really good for the conference. If you were waiting for the presentation to firm up before registering take a look at the schedule. And if you need anymore convincing checkout Lorcan Dempsey's <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000917.html">blog</a> which says it all.</p>
