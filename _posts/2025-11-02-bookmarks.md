    Yet the boat was a refuge. We had wandered in search of somewhere to settle — or, more precisely, somewhere we would be allowed to settle — for four years, moving between whatever cheap, temporary accommodation we could borrow or afford to rent in seven countries, until this unkempt but graceful vessel suggested a possibility of shelter, of ‘fixedness’, even as we were compelled by circumstances to remain mobile, unrooted

      A decentralized future for the open-science databases
    </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="p-summary">
    Continuous and reliable access to curated biological data repositories is indispensable for accelerating rigorous scientific inquiry and fostering reproducible research. Centralized repositories, though widely used, are vulnerable to single points of failure arising from cyberattacks, technical faults, natural disasters, or funding and political uncertainties. This can lead to widespread data unavailability, data loss, integrity compromises, and substantial delays in critical research, ultimately impeding scientific progress. Centralizing essential scientific resources in a single geopolitical or institutional hub is inherently dangerous, as any disruption can paralyze diverse ongoing research. The rapid acceleration of data generation, combined with an increasingly volatile global landscape, necessitates a critical re-evaluation of the sustainability of centralized models. Implementing federated and decentralized architectures presents a compelling and future-oriented pathway to substantially strengthen the resilience of scientific data infrastructures, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the long-term integrity of data. Here, we examine the structural limitations of centralized repositories, evaluate federated and decentralized models, and propose a hybrid framework for resilient, FAIR, and sustainable scientific data stewardship. Such an approach offers a significant reduction in exposure to governance instability, infrastructural fragility, and funding volatility, and also fosters fairness and global accessibility. The future of open science depends on integrating these complementary approaches to establish a globally distributed, economically sustainable, and institutionally robust infrastructure that safeguards scientific data as a public good, further ensuring continued accessibility, interoperability, and preservation for generations to come.

    A quick note: At my company, Cleanview, we recently built a data center tracker. I’ve been following the development of AI and data centers closely for much of the last few years. And even I’ve been shocked by what I’ve learned in building this product. Today I’m publishing the first story that uses our data center tracker. If you want to use the platform, you can sign up for Cleanview here.

    Santa Sangre (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsãn̪.t̪a ˈsãŋ.ɡɾe], 'Holy Blood') is a 1989 surrealist psychological horror film directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky and written by Jodorowsky along with Claudio Argento and Roberto Leoni. It stars Axel Jodorowsky, Adán Jodorowsky, Teo Jodorowsky, Blanca Guerra, Thelma Tixou, and Guy Stockwell. An international co-production of Mexico and Italy, the film is set in Mexico, and tells the story of Fénix, a boy who grew up in a circus and his struggle with childhood trauma.

    Help articulate a critical theoretical framework that can serve as a base for social movements: we perceive that there is a widespread loss of historical memory and a lack of deep understanding of the origin of our current problems, especially what ideologies have brought us here. We want to fight the hopelessness that there is no horizon beyond capitalism with a critical discourse that helps us feel that we can have control over the narrative of our reality.

      How Education Works
    </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="p-summary">
    It’s about how we learn, the nature of knowledge, the very technological nature of humanity, and the very human nature of technology.   It’s about how our participation in (not our just use of) technology brings about knowledge and skills, and it’s about the very complex nature of how that happens. It’s about how education, treated as a technology, actually works rather than how it is designed to work, and why it often fails to work or surprisingly succeeds. It’s about how what we do (the hard methods, tools, theories, models, processes, and structures we employ) is less important than the way that we do it (the soft technique we bring to assemble it all). It’s about the parts we play in the cognition of others, and the parts they play in our own. It is about what it means to be human.
