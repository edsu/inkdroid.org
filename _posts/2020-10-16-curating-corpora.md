Here's a really nice talk by [Everest Pipkin] about the need to curate datasets
for generative text algorithms, especially when they are being used in creative
work. Everest considers creative work broadly as any work where *care* for the
experience is important.

Since I'm teaching a [data curation class] in an information studies
department this semester, but I also work in a [digital humanities
center], this approach to understanding the algorithmic impacts of data
curation is super interesting to me. I particularly liked how Everest
extended this idea of curation to the rules that sit on top of the models,
which select and deslect particular interactions that are useful in
a particular context.

It feels like this creative practice that Everest provides a view into could
actually be more prevalent than the popular press might have it. There is [so
much focus] on obtaining larger and larger datasets, and neural networks with
more and more synapses to approach the complexity found in the brain.

Rather than the selection of an algorithm, tuning its hyperparameters, and the
vast infrastructures for training, being the secret sauce perhaps the data that
is selected, and how model interactions are interpreted are more equally if not
more important, especially in particular contexts.

I guess this also highlights why data assets are so guarded, and why projects
like Wikipedia and Common Crawl are so important for tools like [GPT-3] and
[spaCy]. It would be pretty cool to be able to select a model based on some
subset, or subsets in a dataset like CommonCrawl. Like for example if you
wanted to generate text based on text in a fan fiction site like [AO3]--or even
an author or set of authors within an AO3. Maybe something like that already
exists?
