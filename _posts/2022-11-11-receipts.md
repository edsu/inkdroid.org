The Webrecorder team recently [announced](https://webrecorder.net/2022/11/10/showing-provenance-on-replaywebpage-embeds.html) a new feature that lets you easily embed web archives into your own pages with a bit of JavaScript and a [WACZ](https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz/latest/) file, which will also display "receipts" or provenance information about the archive.

For example here's a NYTimes article that I archived using [ArchiveWebPage](https://archiveweb.page/) into my "Random" collection which I've got stored on Amazon S3 at https://edsu-webarchives.s3.amazonaws.com/random.wacz

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@1.7.2/ui.js"></script>
<replay-web-page 
  style="height: 600px"
  embed="replay-with-info"
  replayBase="/js/replaywebpage/"
  source="https://edsu-webarchives.s3.amazonaws.com/random.wacz"
  url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/11/world/ukraine-war-news-russia-updates" />

The display above was created with this bit of JavaScript that I put into the Markdown for this post (I'm still using the Jekyll static site generator).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@1.7.2/ui.js"></script>
<script>
  <replay-web-page 
    style="height: 600px"
    embed="replay-with-info"
    source="https://edsu-webarchives.s3.amazonaws.com/random.wacz"
    url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/11/world/ukraine-war-news-russia-updates"
    replayBase="/js/replaywebpage/"
  </replay-web-page>
</script>
```
