I know, I know, you've already seen and played [Wordle]. Me too! Since lots of people share their results on social media (e.g. Twitter) did you know you can do this with [twarc]:

```
$ twarc2 counts --granularity day --csv --archive '游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴' wordle-counts.csv
```

Note, this requires having [academic research] turned on for your Twitter app, which lets you use the `--archive` option to go back past a week in history.
