  content: "Nice one, but I doubt he really was referring to Linked Data. Rather what
    Dave mentioned [1]?\r\n\r\nMinor nit: the youtube link you provided doesn't really
    work (ie. it doesn't jump to the 25min 38s). The correct syntax would be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE7k0_9k0VA#t=25m38s\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]

  content: Thanks Michael, I fixed the YouTube link. Apologies for the mis-information
    in my post. It would still be interesting to know if their <em>full link graph</em>
    supported different edge types. But I guess even if they are doing computations
    over a graph of nodes identified w/ URLs and linked together with different predicates
    that still wouldn't be RDF, SPARQL and consequently Linked Data... hohum

<p><a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> of Google <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE7k0_9k0VA#t=25m38s">mentioned</a> Linked Data in his interview with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE7k0_9k0VA">Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/gromgull/status/9918829831">Gunnar</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>
So right from the start researchers are writing code that use our main APIs that<br />
are using the data that everyone else uses. If you want some web pages you use<br />
the full copy of the web. If you want some <b>link<strike>ed</strike> data</b> you use the full link<br />
graph.
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Update:</em> Richard Cyganiak correctly <a href="http://twitter.com/cygri/status/9923214244">points out</a> that Norvig said "link data" not "linked data". :-)  At least we won't have to ask Google if they are using SPARQL and RDF now ...</p>
