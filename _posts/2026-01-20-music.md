> What good is life without music.  
> But that's impossible,

> One man hears it start on his lathe,  
> a mother beats her eggs.  
> There's a typewriter in the next room.  
> Two cars are angry at each other.  
> The baby downstairs is wet again.  
> I remember the voice of a dead friend.  
> Everything speaks at the same time.  
> Music will watch us drown.

> I write letters to all those from whom I receive  
> and to many of those from I don't.  
> I read books, anything, useless piles of random  
> isufferable rubbish for which, in my torpid panic,  
> I fall through time and space each day  
> in my foolish way, remembering only the present feeling,  
> not the village with its face of death  
> nothing to be carried secretly in a car.
