As part of some [research] I've been a part of I've recently had the
opportunity to do a bit of reading and chatting about the special role of
*theorizing* in research. For some context, Jess, Shawn and I have been
spending the past 1/2 a year or so talking about different ways to examine the
*use* of web archives, mostly by looking at links on the web that point at web
archives. If you are interested we're talking about some of this next week as
part of [RESAW2021] (which is free and entirely online).

Part of this work has been trying to generate a set of *categories of use* that
we've been observing in our data. We started out with a predefined set of
categories that were derived from our own previous research and reading. We
started looking for evidence of these categories in our link data. But we found
over the course of doing this work and talking about it that what we were
actually engaged in wasn't really developing a theory per se but *theorizing*.
Recognizing the difference was extremely helpful (thanks Jess!)

Jess introduced us to a couple texts that were very helpful in helping me
distinguish how theorizing is related to theory. Interestingly they also
connected with some [previous work] I've been doing in the classroom. I just
wanted to note these papers here for *Future Me*, with a few notes.

* Hammond, M. (2018). "An interesting paper but not sufficiently theoretical": What does theorising in social research look like?: *Methodological Innovations.* [https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799118787756](https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799118787756)

* Swedberg, R. (2012). Theorizing in sociology and social science: Turning to the context of discovery. *Theory and Society*, 41(1), 1â€“40. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5)

The Hammond paper was the gateway to the Swedberg, but I read them the other
way around. It didn't matter too much because both papers are about the role of
theorizing in research, and how it's related to but distinct from research
involving a theory. If you read them definitely read the Hammond first because
its shorter, and sets things up nicely for the deeper dive that Swedberg
provides.

Hammond reviews the literature around theorizing (which includes Swedberg) and
also discusses some interviews he conducted with researchers at his university
to better understand the role of theory in their work. These first person
accounts were helpful because they highlighted the degree of uncertainty and
anxiety that researchers felt around their use of theory. Hammond and his
participants noted the connection to Grounded theory [@Glaser:1967], and the
role of reflexivity in qualitative methods more generally. But he suggestes
that a broader discussion of theorizing takes it out of the realm of what
happens when asking specific research questions, and into the exploratory work
that needs to happen before. 

Hammond's basic point is that theorizing is the search for explanations, not
the explanation itself. It is the process of identifying 'patterns and
regularities' that can sometimes lead to hypothesis and theory. The Swedberg
piece does many things, but its basic point is that this theorizing work is
crucial for theory, and that it's not really talked about enough. The premium
is on the theory, but that we are often left in the dark about how that theory
was generated, because all the focus goes into the verification of that theory.
Swedberg has this idea of the *prestudy* which is work that happens before
a theory is expressed, and tested/verified. The prestudy is empirical work that
is creative and aimed at making a discovery. He draws quite a bit on Peirce's
idea of abductive reasoning, or the practice of guessing right. He
pushes back on the idea that empirical data should only be collected in the
context of theory justification, and that data is extremely valuable in
exploratory work.

In addition to Peirce, Swedberg also draws on Wittgenstein's philosophy of
"Don't think but look!" which highlights how existing concepts (theories) can
actually be a barrier to insight. Sometimes simply restating phenomena without
using the name of the concept can unlock things. He also mentions
@Bachelard:1984 "epistemological obstacles" to theorizing such as managing data
when theorizing, and overly reliance on existing theory instead of engaging in
theorizing. I've definitely experienced the managing data problem as we've been
looking at links to web archives at multiple levels of abstraction, and how to
keep them organized for recall without overly prescribing what they signify. He
also cites @Mills:2000 quite a bit who stressed that researchers should strive
to be their own theorist in addition to being their own methodologist--and that
theorizing can be learned. One method he suggested for gaining insight and
bypassing existing theories is to dump out all the data (folders in his case)
and sorting them again.

Swedberg's idea of the prestudy is compelling I think because in part it is
a call for there to be more writing about the prestudy so that we can learn how
to do it. This reminds me a bit of what I really liked about @Law:2004 which
attempted to look at where social science gets done. If we don't know
where our ideas come from how will be able to recognize what they contain, and
what they might be missing? For Swedberg theorizing can be neatly summarized
as:

1. *Observing* and *choosing* something to investigate 
2. *Naming* the central concept(s)
3. Building* out a theory (metaphors, comparisons, diagrams)
4. *Completing* the tentative theory

The goal of theorizing is to build *heuristic* tools, tools that are
unpolished, a bit messy, fit to purpose and non-formalized rather than
definitive explanations.

> ... concepts should primarily be used as heuristic tools at the stage of
theorizing, that is, to discover something new, and not to block the discovery
process by forcing some interesting observation into some bland category.
Insisting on exact operational definitions is usually not helpful at this
stage. According to a well-known formulation, concepts should at this stage be
seen as sensitizing and not as definitive. 

I'm just grateful for this connection between theorizing and some elements of
pragmatic philosophy that I've been drawn to for some time ... and also to have
some new people to read: Mills and Bachelard. Practical advice for theorizing,
and how to do it, is especially important when starting new projects, and seems
like an essential ingredient for staying happy and productive in this line of
work. It should be hard, but it should be fun too, right?
