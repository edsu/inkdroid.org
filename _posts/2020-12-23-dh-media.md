This is a really excellent lecture by [Bernhard Rieder] about what Digital
Humanities and Media Studies have in common, how they are different, and
why it matters.

Since starting to work in a group that has traditionally seen itself as firmly
planted in the digital humanities I've sometimes found myself a bit perplexed
by the disciplinary walls that seem to come up in projects, when the object of
study isn't a traditional media form like a book, or a piece of art, a piece of
music, a dance, etc. I've come up against this a bit in my own research into how archives function on the web, because I chose to see web archives as part of set of practices that extend back in time, to the pre-digital world of paper and print (which of course are information technologies as well). One thing I like about the media studies approach is it sees various forms of media as part of a continuum of technologies, where the digital isn't necessarily exceptional or privileged.

As Rieder points out, the debates around what is, and is not, DH are widely
recognized to be a bit stale now. But understanding the similarities and
differences between digital humanities and media studies is still highly relevant, especially for interdisciplinary, collaborative scholarship. I very much liked Rieder's approach of laying out the differences and similarities in terms of his [Mapping YouTube] project, and the theoretical and methodological influences that guided the work he and his collaborators
undertook.

The key message I took away is that the primary difference between digital humanities and media studies *has* traditionally been the *objects of study*. For example, asking questions about a [large collection of printed books] is fundamentally different from asking questions about [a social media platform]. But the way one goes about answering these questions (the methods) can actually be quite similar in both areas. In fact digital methods, and the theories they draw on, are something that bring these two disciplines into alignment, and make them vibrant sites for collaborative work. I used the past tense *has* there because I agree with Rieder that the differences are breaking down significantly as digital humanities research increasingly analyzes the contemporary, and media studies itself has a historical component.

A few things I learned about that I want to follow up on:

* The idea of [platform vernacular] developed by Gibbs et al to describe the ways that communicative practice evolve in platforms. 

* The practice of [exploratory data analysis] which I feel like I've understood intuitively in much of my work, but am somewhat abashed to admit I didn't realize was [written about] by John Tukey back in 1977. The goal of EDA is for data analysis to help in the formulation of hypotheses, rather than the  testing of a hypothesis. It is also useful for gaining insights into what *more* data needs to be collected. I'm kind of curious to see what relation, if any, this idea of exploratory data analysis might have with Peirce's idea of [abductive reasoning].

* I've known about Rieder's book [Engines of Order] for a few months now, and really need to move it up the to-read pile. In my own recently completed dissertation work I looked at how algorithms (fixity algorithms) participate in complex systems of control, and knowledge production. So I'm interested to see what argument Rieder makes, and hope to learn a bit more about [Simondon], who I've had some difficulty understanding in the past. (Although, I did enjoy this offbeat and accessible [documentary] about his life & work.)
