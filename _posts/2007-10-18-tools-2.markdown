At $work recently many late nights were spent hackety-hacking on a prototype that got <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/technology/18world.html">written up</a> in the New York Times today. Apart from some <a href="http://www.worlddigitallibrary.org">promotional</a> materials, not much is available to the public just yet. I just got pulled in near the end to do some search stuff. Over the past few months I've seen <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net">dchud</a> in top form managing complicated data/organizational workflows while making technical decisions. A nice outgrowth of working with smarties is ending up with a fun and productive technology stack: <a href="http://python.org">python</a>, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">postgres</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jquery</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr">solr</a>, <a href="http://tilecache.org/">tilecache</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">vmware</a>. Given the press and the commitment to UNESCO I think the code is going to start being a bit more than a prototype pretty soon :-)</p>
