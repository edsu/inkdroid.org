I was so pleased to <a href="http://www.venganza.org">read</a> recently that there are others who find it appalling that the Kansas School Board isn't considering teaching the solid scientific evidence for the Flying Spaghetti Monster. If the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">statistics</a> on pirates and global warming  aren't enough to convince you, I have a little story to relate. One night I was driving along the road, and I saw some strange lights in the clouds. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but when I pulled over and got out I caught the aroma of spaghetti sauce and cooked pasta. I looked at my shirt, and didn't see any spaghetti stains so I immediately thought that it had been the Flying Spaghetti Monster in the clouds. The next day I decided to hire an artist to draw what I imagined the Flying Spaghetti Monster to look like, lurking in the clouds. The result is above, and it's *exactly* like the one I have seen reported elsewhere! Since I paid for this artist to do the picture, it is obviously scientifically accurate. I hope that this leaves no doubt in your mind, that FSM is not only a reality, but a very cool one indeed.</p>
