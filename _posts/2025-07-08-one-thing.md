Gerald Stern:

> If I could choose one poem of mine to explain my stance, or my artistic position, it would be "The One Thing in Life," which appears in Lucky Life. In this poem I stake out a place for myself, so to speak, that was overlooked or ignored or disdained, a place no one else wanted. I mean this in a psychological and metaphorical and philosophical sense. 
> 
> When I think about the place "no one else wanted," I think of an abandoned or despised area. I think of weeds, a ruin, a desert, but I think of these things not as remote in time or place from that which is familiar and cherished and valuable—our civilization—but as things that lie just under the surface and just out of eyesight. (Bradish, pp. 1486-1487).
