As a [weekend experiment] I was looking at how to determine the Twitter accounts
for a list of non-profits. In the process I created a more generalized tool
called [luckysocial] that will:

1. Do an *I'm Feeling Lucky* search on Google (the first hit for a query)
2. Look for social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) on the
   lucky page.

Here's how it looks at the command line, although you can also use it in batch
mode to annotate a CSV file:

```text
% luckysocial 'University of Maryland'

name: University of Maryland
homepage: https://www.umd.edu/
twitter: https://twitter.com/UofMaryland
facebook: https://www.facebook.com/UnivofMaryland
instagram: https://www.instagram.com/univofmaryland
youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/UMD2101
```

While I was at it I thought it could be fun  to look for an RSS feed on the page
too:

```text
% luckysocial 'Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities'

name: Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities
homepage: https://mith.umd.edu/
twitter: https://twitter.com/umd_mith
rss: https://mith.umd.edu/feed/
```

Running the tool over the 2023 non-profits I was working with I was surprised a
bit by the coverage:

* Twitter: 68%
* Facebook: 72%
* Instagram: 54%
* YouTube: 18%
* RSS: 56%

I was kinda surprised that Twitter fared almost as well as Facebook since
Facebook's footprint is claimed to be so much bigger on the web. Although
perhaps that's just an artifact of these non-profits.

But the main thing that stood out to me was the number of RSS feeds on these
websites.  I didn't dive into the details yet but I suspect this may be the
result of the heavy presence of Wordpress in these non-profit sites.

I find this heartening that after years of people saying RSS is dead, it clearly
is not. Partly in celebration, and continuing my [revolt] against corporate
social media, I installed [FreshRSS] here on inkdroid.org. I've never really
loved using [Feedly] since Google Reader bit the dust, and I've been wanting to
learn more about how [WebSub] works. So hopefully this would be another fun
experiment in old-web technology.

And speaking of old-web, opensource technology: I've gotta hand it to Wordpress
for their continued ability to withstand the corporate social media juggernaut.
