<p>In case you missed it in your overstuffed RSS reader Jon Udell recently <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/01.html#a1570">interviewed</a> John Price-Wilkin who is coordinating the University of Michigan's joint digitization project with Google.</p>
<p>The interview covers interesting bits of history about the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090401160917/http://www.si.umich.edu:80/UMDL/">University of Michigan Digital Library</a>,<br />
<a href="http://moa.umdl.umich.edu">Making of America</a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> (didn't realize there was a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JSTOR-History-Roger-C-Schonfeld/dp/0691115311/">book</a>), and of course the project with Google.</p>
<p>The shocker for me was that while the UMDL has been able to digitize 3000 books per year, Google is doing approximately that number <em>a day</em>. Wilkin wasn't able to go into details about just how Google is doing this, but he does talk about details such as resolutions used, destructive vs non-destructive digitization, and how federations of libraries could work with this data.</p>
<p>Wilkin has been at the center of digital library efforts for as long as I've been working with libraries and technology, so it was really fun to hear this interview.</p>
