> The recordings for the Leeds and Witmark demos were never intended for public consumption, but were made to sell Dylan's songs to other artists. The demo sessions took place in a tiny 6-by-8-foot studio at Witmark's offices in the Look Building at 51st Street and Madison Avenue, where an engineer would capture the performances on a reel-to-reel. To save tape, the demos were recorded at 7.5 inches per second, half the speed used in professional studios. A Witmark copyist would then transcribe the lyrics and music from the tape, and song sheets would be printed and mailed to recording companies. When a company's artist expressed an interest in a song, Witmark would cut an acetate, a recording on inexpensive plastic, that would be sent to the artist for preview purposes. If acceptable, the song would be recorded. [The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._9:_The_Witmark_Demos:_1962%E2%80%931964)

The image of Mr Z. rattling off these songs, and recording them on the cheapest material, in the cheapest possible way, so that other artists could decide whether they wanted to record them for real seems so ephemeral, like some kind of pre-web social media. It's amazing that they survived and could be turned into an album.
