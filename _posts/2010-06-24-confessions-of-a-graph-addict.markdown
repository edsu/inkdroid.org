<p>Today I'm going to be at the annual conference of the <a href="http://www.ala.org">American Library Association</a> today for a pre-conference about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100724135242/http://www.ala.org:80/ala/mgrps/divs/alcts/confevents/upcoming/ala/ac10/linked.cfm">Libraries and Linked Data</a>.  I'm going to try talking about how Linked Data, and particularly how the graph data structure fits the way catalogers have typically thought about bibliiographic information. Along the way I'll include some specific examples of Linked Data projects I've worked on at the Library of Congress--and gesture at work that remains to be done.</p>

<p>Tomorrow there's an <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lld/2010Jun/0047.html">unconference</a> style event at ALA to explore the what Linked Data means for Libraries. The pre-conference today is booked up, but the event tomorrow is open to the public, so please consider dropping by if you are interested and in the DC area.</p>
