In case you missed it linux.com is running an <a href="http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/06/12/04/1538214.shtml?tid=101">article</a> by Michael Stutz on Evergreen, an open source integrated library system developed by the state of Georgia to support a consortium of 44 different libraries. (Thanks for the link <a href="http://use.perl.org/~ziggy/journal/">Adam</a>)</p>
<p>Hanging out with miker_ and bradl in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib">irc</a> and having <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130502121736/http://open-ils.org/blog/">open-ils</a> in my feed reader makes me take this sort of work for granted sometimes...and Michael's article made me wake up and marvel at how truly remarkable the work they've done is.</p>
<p>The evergreen folks are hosting this years <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007">code4libcon</a> where I'm supposed to be doing a presentation on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/summers">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>. It's a low cost/pragmatic alternative to the usual library technology conference options--and will be a good opportunity to buy these Evergreeners a beer. I hope to see you there.</p>
