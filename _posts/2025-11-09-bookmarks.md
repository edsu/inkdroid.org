    I'm not aware of resuscitating anything, really. I just enjoy playing and finding new ways to surprise myself. It all happens organically. There's not a lot of strategizing that goes into it. There's no plan. I love the history of the guitar and of guitar players, so it's a conversation I want to be part of.

    We verify, to the best of our abilities, that people who say they’re Palestinians from Gaza are who they say they are by holding video conversations with them.

Beyond that, we’re in touch with them daily and trying to help them raise funds to stay alive.

    Offsetting is a worldview that insists that problems created by capital accumulation can only be resolved by further capital accumulation. On a finite planet, the search for new forms of capital begins to resemble a hall of mirrors. A tree, for example, becomes a fractal, recursive commodity, with hidden dimensions of value waiting to be uncurled, like hypothetical extra dimensions of space and time. Offsetting is a product of last-stage, recursive, data-driven capitalism, and its brilliance is that it allows any human activity to be commodified by means of measurement, data collection, and computation

      FBI Tries to Unmask Owner of Infamous Archive.is Site
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    The FBI is attempting to unmask the owner behind archive.today, a popular archiving site that is also regularly used to bypass paywalls on the internet and to avoid sending traffic to the original publishers of web content, according to a subpoena posted by the website. The FBI subpoena says it is part of a criminal investigation, though it does not provide any details about what alleged crime is being investigated. Archive.today is also popularly known by several of its mirrors, including archive.is and archive.ph.

    On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”

      Estimating Carbon Emissions From Income
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    Most individual carbon footprint calculators only factor in consumption. How many plane trips have you taken this year? How many car miles have you driven? And so on. And, numerous studies and papers have drawn out the relationship between individual or household consumption and emissions. On the other hand, far fewer studies have attempted to calculate emissions based income.

Is it possible to estimate individual or household emissions based on income alone, without any consideration for consumption choices?

      Frozen DuckLakes for Multi-User, Serverless Data Access
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    DuckLakes typically consist of two components: the catalog database and the storage. Obviously, there is no way around having some sort of storage to represent the data. But can we host a DuckLake without setting up a catalog database? In this blog post, we'll show how you can create a read-only cloud-based DuckLake without a database server. We call this a “Frozen DuckLake” because it is read-only and has no moving parts other than a cloud storage system.

      DuckLake: SQL as a Lakehouse Format
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    To resolve the fundamental problems of the existing lakehouse architecture, we have created a new open table format called DuckLake. DuckLake re-imagines what a “lakehouse” format should look like by acknowledging two simple truths:

1. Storing data files in open formats on blob storage is a great idea for scalability and to prevent lock-in.

2. Managing metadata is a complex and interconnected data management task best left to a database management system.

      Let Them Eat Large Language Models: Artificial Intelligence and Austerity in the Neoliberal University
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    This article examines the expansion of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) into higher education. We argue that genAI’s incursion into university systems represents an effort by Silicon Valley to capture lucrative new markets for their products, as well as enhanced credibility by association. Drawing on our experience as faculty in the California State University (CSU) system—the first university system to contract with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu system-wide—we assess the rhetoric that justifies and legitimizes genAI contracts in higher education. We suggest that the uncritical adoption of genAI in higher education poses problems for labor conditions, the integrity of intellectual property, and student learning on campuses, particularly under the conditions of austerity that are commonly found in public universities.

      How to Be a Good Citizen When Your Country Does Bad Things
    </a>
  </h2>
  <section class="p-summary">
    When your country pursues abhorrent policies, when the face it turns to the world is the face of a monster, what does that say about you? In my experience, it is strikingly easy to shrug off one’s responsibility for the country where one pays taxes, contributes to the public conversation and, at least nominally, has the right to vote, if that country is the United States. It seems one can just say “Not in my name” and continue to enjoy the wealth and the freedom of movement one’s citizenship confers. But as this country builds more cages for immigrants, deploys military force against civilians in city after city, regularly commits murder in the high seas and systematically destroys its own democratic institutions, that may change. It should change. What does one do then? How can one be a good citizen of a bad state
