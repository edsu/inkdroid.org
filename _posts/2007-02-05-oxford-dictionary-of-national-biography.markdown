<p>It's interesting to see that the <a href="http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a> has created <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs</a> for their index of notable people. So for example if you want an identifier for JRR Tolkien you can use:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101031766">http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101031766</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, the full content of the biography isn't available (unless you subscribe), but I guess some publishers still have business models to hold on to. To see all the entries you have to <a href="http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/index/browsing/">browse</a> them.</p>
<p>I think it's a nice simple example of how authority files can be integrated into the web as we know it. Thanks to Caroline Arms for forwarding this on to me...</p>
