I [wrote recently] about twarc2 and the support for Twitter's v2 API, but
I also just wanted to share this session that I did on April 22, 2021 with
Suhem Parack on the TwitterDev Twitch about installing twarc2 and using it to
collect data from the Twitter v2 API. We focused our discussion primarily on
researchers who have access to the Academic Product Track, which allows
searching of the full archive of tweets.

This video is hosted on the [Nocturlab's PeerTube] instance which is nice
because if you watch it while other people happen to be looking at it too you
will download parts of it from them using the magic of [PeerTube] and
[WebTorrent].

But, in case that fails for whatever reason, there's also a [backup at the
Internet Archive].
