<p><a href="http://code4lib.org"><img src="http://www.code4lib.org/themes/panizzi/logo.png" border=0 style="padding: 10px;" align="left" /></a> So tomorrow I'm headed for Corvallis, Oregon to attend the first ever <a href="http://code4lib.org/2006">code4lib conference</a>. It's been amazing to watch this conference start as a glimmer in the eye of a handful of people in IRC and turn into a real event attended by 80 library technologists from all over the place. </p>
<p>I'm planning on doing a lightning talk or two, and had spent some time preparing some slides which I tossed in the end. I'm going to talk about using eclipse, microformats and object-relational-mapping -- hopefully by just doing some live coding. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I plan on taking some copious notes, so keep your eye on <a href="http://planet.code4lib.org">planet.code4lib.org</a> for the play by play.</p>
