This album has been in and out of my headphones since it got released back at the end of
June. It was particularly helpful as I spent the month of July away from
$work as I was wrote up the last chunk of my dissertation. Maybe there was
something about listening to music that was created with a research question in
mind :)

> Built with the aim of offering a sonic resource for comfort and calming,
> composer Danny Clay and The Living Earth Show (percussionist Andy Meyerson and
> guitarist Travis Andrews) created Music for Hard Times: an eight movement work
> crafted using a series of composed "calming exercises," recorded independently
> in their homes using instruments, voices, field recordings, and found objects.
> The work is built to be listened to on a continuous loop if desired--that is,
> the eighth movement segues back into the first so that the listener has agency
> over the length of their own listening experience. Music for Hard Times is a
> work of experimental music in the truest sense, in that it was created to
> answer a fundamental research question: “is it possible for us to use the
> tools of classical art music to make people feel better?”
