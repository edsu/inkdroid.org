It's hard to read Scott's description of govermentality and not think of the
archive. The archive is often directly associated with state, corporate and
institutional power [@Jimerson:2009], sometimes even going back millennia
[@Derrida:1996]. The vast scope of effects of writing and record making/keeping
is a major theme in this book, which at a surface level seems to be about
archaeology and agriculture.

Hyperfocusing on the governmentality of archives and record keeping practices
actually helps throw into relief aspects of the archive that decenter this
traditional story of archival work. It allows us to focus instead on archives as
spaces for community, activism, resistance [@Pell:2015 ; @Flinn:2009] as well as
desire, affect [@Cifor:2018 ; @Caswell:2016] and re-imagination
[@Gilliland:2016].

Is it at all useful to consider how these re-conceptions of archival work map
onto web infrastructures [@Srinivasan:2017]?  Does the web really offer us new
modes for participation, or does the slippage in media forms provide the
breathing room necessary for us to really question what an archive is, and who
an archivist can be?  [@Huvila:2015]?

Like much of Scott's other work I think Against the Grain implicitly invites us
to think about the new algorithmic readers for our digitalized and networked
records (aka Big Data). The Empire has always struck back against our attempts
to transform archival work, and the standards and inner workings of web
infrastructure are knowingly, or unknowingly, complicit in this truly ancient
project of legibility. What modes of resistance and solidarity will help us
cultivate new genres of archive that are needed for our survival?

Lots of questions -- let me know your answers!
