It's hard to read Scott's description of govermentality and not think of the
archive. The archive is often directly associated with state, corporate and
institutional power [@Jimerson:2009], sometimes even going back millennia
[@Derrida:1996]. The vast scope of effects of writing and record making/keeping
is a major theme in this book, which at a surface level seems to be about
archaeology and agriculture.

Hyperfocusing on the governmentality of archives and record keeping practices
actually helps throw into relief aspects of the archive that decenter this
traditional story of archival work. It allows us to focus instead on archives as
spaces for community, activism, resistance [@Pell:2015 ; @Flinn:2009] as well as
desire, affect [@Cifor:2018 ; @Caswell:2016] and re-imagination
[@Gilliland:2016].

Is it at all useful to consider how these re-conceptions of archival work map
onto web infrastructures [@Srinivasan:2017]?  Does the web really offer us new
modes for participation, or does the slippage in media forms provide the
breathing room for us to question what an archive is, and who an archivist can
be?  [@Huvila:2015]?

I think Scott also invites us to think about the new algorithmic audiences for
legibility that the web and the digitalization of our records (aka Big Data)
provide. The Empire Strikes Back against our attempts to transform archival
work, and the standards and inner workings of web infrastructure may be
knowingly or unknowingly complicit in this truly ancient project of legibility.
