Here's [Langdon Winner] talking about the effects of computing and telecommunications in 1984 [@Winner:1984]. It's kind of astonishing that this much was visible to him thirty years ago.

Thanks to [Roxanne Gay] for her recent [The Blog That Disappeared] that points to [Winner's] idea of *mythinformation*. Winner uses mythinformation to name the ideology that open access to information technology is necessarily a good thing, and that we needn't spend time and effort thoughtfully and actively crafting its deployment. After reading his [Wikipedia page] it also seems that Winner was an early proponent of the idea that artifacts can have politics...a notion that seems congruent with the idea that archives, while seeming neutral, have politics as well.
