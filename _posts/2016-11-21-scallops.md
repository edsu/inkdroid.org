Callon, M. (1984). [Some elements of a sociology of translation: domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St Brieuc Bay.](https://bscw.uni-wuppertal.de/pub/nj_bscw.cgi/d8022008/Callon_SociologyTranslation.pdf) *The Sociological Review*, 32(S1):196â€“233.

This article by [Michael Callon] has come up in again and again in my readings
about [Practice Theory] this fall. I guess it makes sense given the affiliation
between Science and Technology Studies and Practice Theory. Google Scholar says
it has been [cited] 8,080 times which is kind of curious for a story about
scallops, scientists and fishermen in a small bay along the northern coast of
France.

Of course there's more to it: Callon along with [Bruno Latour] and [John Law]
helped to establish [Actor Network Theory] or ANT in the 1980s.  I've written
about ANT here before, it's nothing new really -- but the thing that still
interests me about it is the very thing it is controversial for: considering
non-human actors.

So in terms of foundational texts for ANT @Callon:1984 is important. After 30
years and thousands of citations I'm not going to say anything new. I suspect
the world has moved on to some extent, as Law [seemed] to indicate a few years
ago. But I thought I would just jot down the main ideas to make them a bit more
concrete in my mind so I can return to them as needed.

The paper's primary concern is the idea of *translation*, or the sociology of
translation, in which actors are involved in a particular set of interactions.
The case study are the scientists who are attempting to transplant techniques
for breeding scallops from Japan to France, to help ensure that the ecosystem in
France is not disrupted, and fishermen can continue to fish there.  Callon looks
at the way this network of interactions is established through four aspects of
translation: 

* **problematization**: the definition of the research problem (will the
    technique for breeding scallops work, and help the fishermen) which makes 
    the scientists indispensable 
* **interessment**: the ways which the other actors are enticed into
    participation.
* **enrollment**: the enactment of participation, or how things actually go down
* **mobilization**: whether what happened is said to be representative of for
    allies of the actors involved.

If this all sounds overly abstract, that's because it is. Callon tries to make
it concrete, but perhaps something is lost in translation from the French (pun
intended). However, the idea of translation isn't really what's interesting to
me about this paper. What's more significant are the methodological principles
that Callon articulates for the approach he is taking:

1. **agnosticism**: to allow actors to make statements about the social world,
   not just the natural world. This allows them to have more fluid identities
   and to participate in multiple ways. I guess this was a big thing for the
   social study of science, where scientists were previously only interesting
   for what they said about the natural world, and not for their observations
   about their social worlds.
2. **symmetry**: whatever the analytical tool that is being used, in this case
   translation, it must be applied in both technical and social worlds. It can't
   be only applied in one, and then shifting to use another when talking about
   the other.
3. **free association**: the observer must reject the idea that there is a
   boundary between the natural and the social. The observer should follow the
   various actors and see how they define their worlds, instead of having a
   particular pre-established grid of analysis imposed on them.

The big message here is the dissolving the differences between the social and
the natural. The human is decentered, and the stories and lives of artifacts and
objects become as important as that of the people involved. The requirement for
actors to have agency is dismantled or dismissed. The scallops participate with
the fishermen and the scientists in a flattened space. The paper is important
not so much for the idea of translation, as for the space Callon carves out for
social scientists to operate on an equal footing with scientists--not looming
over them like the sociology police.

Perhaps It's time to read @Latour:2005 [again]. But I think I might get more out
of reading some new stuff (for me), like @Mol:2002 and @Tsing:2015 which I have
queued up for winter break. I suspect ANT might be academically trendy, or
post-trendy, but I like the disciplined attention to thick description and
material. It's an approach and sensibility I'm hoping to cultivate in my own
work.
