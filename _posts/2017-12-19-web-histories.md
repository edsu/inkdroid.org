title: Web Histories 
---

@Rogers:2017 provides a useful introduction of how to use screencasts of
archived web content as a method when doing web history. He credits [Jon Udell]
for coming up with the *software as movie* technique in his [screencast] of the
editing history of the Wikipedia article [Heavy Metal Umlaut]. The contribution
Rogers makes is applying this method to historical work with web archives, which
he does in the [Google and the politics of tabs] screencast.

The article contains a description of the method itself, which is to use the
[Wayback Machine] as a data source, [Grab Them All] for collecting screenshots,
and [iMovie] for knitting the images together into a video which can then be
narrated. Identifying what URLs to screencap is an important step to the
process, and Rogers explains some of the features of the Wayback Machine to make
this easier to understand.

Apart from the method itself Rogers thinks more generally about the
historiography of web archives. Specifically he distinguishes between different
types of histories that can be conducted with the archived web content:

> In the following, narrations or particular goals for telling the history of a
> website are put forward. They offer means to study the history of the Web (as
> seen through a single website like Google Web Search), the history of the Web
> as media (such as how a newspaper has grappled with the new medium) as well
> as the history of a particular institution (such as the US White House or
> marriage, as seen through a leading wedding website). Arguably, the first is a
> form of Web and medium history, the second media history, and the third
> digital history, however much each also blends the approaches and blurs the
> distinctions.

Reading the rest of the article helps to understand these distinctions, but it
took me several reads until I felt like I understood the differences here. It
helped me to consider *why* the archived web content is being studied.

Is the archived content being studied to better understand:

1. the website?
2. the web as a medium?
3. a real-world phenomena that leaves traces on, or is entangled with, the web?

As Rogers says, these things blur together quite a bit. It's hard to imagine
studying the web as a medium (2) without looking at specific examples of web
content (1), or considering the social, cultural, political and economic factors
that gave rise to it. But I still think these categories are a useful rubric or
guidepost for characterizing how scholars work with archived web content,
particularly when emphasis is placed more in one area than another. As Rogers
says it's also important to consider that the Wayback Machine itself is a
historical artifact.

The article also pointed me to some work that has been done about the use of web
archives as evidence in legal settings and authenticity [@Gazaryan:2013 ;
@Andersen:2013 ; @Russell:2008] which I'd heard about before [@Zittrain:2014]
but not actually seen referenced from a humanities perspective.

Also, Rogers points to @Chun:2011 as a way of talking about different forms of
digital ephemerality that historians encounter in web archives. @Chun:2016
was already on my reading list for the coming months, but I may have to add this
one too, particularly because of the software studies angle [it seems] to take.
