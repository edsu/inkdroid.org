<p>The FCC is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212134150/https://www.eff.org//Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/FCC_voip_wiretaps.pdf">mandating</a> that Internet providers and network appliance manufacturers build in backdoors so that the spooks can monitor electronic communication between, well you know, terrorists and stuff. What a profoundly bad idea...do they <em>really</em> think that the secret access mechanism will stay a secret? And when it leaks out, what sort of access will the crooks have, and will they ever know it was leaked?</p>
<p>At least the effort to tap is on the table, unlike the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081201090832/http://www.totse.com/en/privacy/encryption/des_prob.html">Data Encryption Standard</a> which was supposedly introduced with a deliberately small keysize to ease decoding by the NSA.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ever vigilant <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080706013823/http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_08.php">EFF</a> for reporting on this. Which reminds me, my membership is up for renewal.</p>
