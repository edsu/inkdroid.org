title: Comprehensively Collecting the Web

I had some interesting conversations after [my talk] yesterday. In particular
[Nicholas Taylor] asked me a provocative question, playing Devil's advocate a
bit, because I don't think his work as an archivist demonstrates this
approach at all. I'm paraphrasing:

> If we are concerned about systematic bias in archives, wouldn't it 
> be better for archivists to comprehensively collect in an area rather
> than being selective? If we attempt to collect all of something then
> we are less likely to project our own bias and preferences into 
> our collections.

It's a compelling logical argument that, on its face, doesn't seem easy to
refute. But I think it does come apart if we consider two things:

1. What *area* should the archivist collect in? If the archivist is going to
   comprehensively collect in an area like [computer science] how does the
   archivist choose that area? They must make choices about what to collect at
   some level, and if they aren't prepared to say why one area over another then
   how is the archive not biased?

2. The second was the topic of [my talk] yesterday, in which I tried to argue,
   somewhat obliquely, that the accelerated growth of the web and social media, 
   are a reflection of a capitalist mode of production that is literally
   eating our world alive. If every country on earth had a [legal deposit]
   program, and were somehow able to comprehensively archive their corner of the
   web, we would be greatly deepening this crisis.

So we must confront the fact that we have to make choices, and be prepared to
talk about those choices. It's ok for us to talk about our efforts to be
comprehensive as long as it is tempered with a real discussion of the ways in
which it is not--and documenting the trade offs. Maybe its easier just to
abandon the idea of archives being comprehensive altogether, but archivists
clutch fiercely to this idea because their professional identity seems bound up
with it. 

Furthermore, if we are archiving the web, we must face up to the fact that we
cannot archive it all, and that this is, in fact, a very good thing for our
planet.

Of course this argument of mine is really nothing new, and is just a rehash of
decades of discussion about appraisal in archives, in response to challenges
from @Ham:1981, @Bearman:1989, @Hedstrom:1991 right at the dawn of the World
Wide Web. I think we are still coming to terms with their work, and seeing how
it fits with this World Wide Web we have today. It is particularly relevant as
archives of the web are being used to create computational models and algorithms
that we interact with in our daily life [@boyd:2012 ; @Noble:2018] and make
policy decisions [@Eubanks:2018].
