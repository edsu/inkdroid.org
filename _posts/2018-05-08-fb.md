**TL;DR Facebooks's [Community Standards] aren't versioned and appear to be
engineered to resist the idea of versioning.**

Yesterday I attended the [Content Moderation at Scale] meeting held in
Washington DC, which had representatives of large social media platforms like
Facebook, Twitter, Google, Wikipedia, Twitch, Vimeo, Trip Advisor talking about
their processes for content moderation. These companies were joined by
representatives from the Department of Homeland Security and Europol. This was
an east coast version of a similar event that happened at Santa Clara University
earlier this year called [Content Moderation and Removal at Scale]. But if you
look at the speaker list you can see it wasn't exactly getting the band back
together. It's also interesting to note that bringing the event to DC brought in
some new sponsors, including the [CATO Institute], [Charles Koch Institute] and
[Craig Newmark Philanthropies]. Yes, quite a diverse (and powerful) set of
actors are interested in this topic.

As you can imagine a lot of stuff happened, some of which you can see reflected
in the [Twitter stream], and the [slides] and [videos] are online for the
moment. Unfortunately there was very little opportunity for question & answer
with the audience after the presentations from the various companies, and by my
recollection none of the participants asked questions of each other. So even
though it had a light breezy feel to it, this was a tightly controlled event,
and in many ways it had to be, to get these people up on stage to talk about
this very sensitive topic at all.

As I said, there was very little Q&amp;A with the audience, but there was an
online form that was used for people to submit questions to the moderator.
Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention but I didn't hear very many questions
coming from this system, and there was very little time for discussion after the
various presentations anyway. I submitted one question, that was not asked,
which is the topic of the remainder of this post.

One of the highlights of the day for me was [Tal Niv] of GitHub talking about
how they use GitHub itself to make their [policies] available.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tal Niv
talks about how their community and terms of service documents are maintained by
their legal team using GitHub itself to manage changes and gather issues, etc.

This means that issues are versioned, with a clear history of how they have
changed and when. In addition anyone with a (free) GitHub account can create
[issues] that ask questions, or fork the policy and send a [pull request] with a
suggested change. Now it appears that only 7 people have actually contributed to
the repository--but it is the principle that matters here. For example we can
see that the repository has largely been shepherded by [Joseph Mazzella] who is
Product Counsel at GitHub.  We can see what he changed and his comments provide
some context about why. I think this level of transparency is important for
community building.

Community was an essential and oft repeated concept that participants used to
talk about how their moderation guidelines work. Specifically Facebook's
recently released [Community Standards] were held up by Facebook representatives
Peter Stern and Katilin Sullivan. They described a "mini-legislature" that put
these standards together, which really operate as the law of Facebook. Is it
possible to think of 2 billion people as a community? Maybe? It's certainly
different than thinking of Vimeo as a community, which has 2 million users and
allows you to pay money for the right to host your content with them, instead of
profiting off of selling your data to third parties. But I digress.

My question for the transparency panel was: Have Facebook considered using a
process like GitHub's for making the changes to their community guidelines
clear? At the moment there doesn't appear to be a changelog for the guidelines
so it's hard to understand how/if they have changed. There doesn't appear to be
a way to ask questions about the document, or to suggest changes. Facebook
already have a [GitHub account] so this wouldn't be asking them to use something
that they weren't using already. This level of transparency (at least for the
changes) seems important if Facebook is taking their community guidelines
seriously.

But the situation is actually worse. The community guidelines themselves are
broken up into different sections, which appear to be at different URLs. In
itself this isn't really a problem. But these aren't separate URLs for different
documents. The community standards are a small JavaScript application, which
dynamically fetches the contents from Facebook's servers when you click on the
sections. If you want to take a look at this open up the Developer Tools in your
browser and look at the network pane while clicking around. This means that it's
really quite difficult to snapshot a version of the community standards.  For
example [Internet Archive] is currently not able to render them, they just
appear as an empty shell:

<a href="https://web.archive.org/communitystandards/introduction/"><img
class="img-responsive" src="/images/facebook-community.png"></a>

Fortunately [Webrecorder] does seem to be able to capture the site, since it
allows you to interactively click the section links, and uses your browser to
run the JavaScript application. But this won't really work in a scenario where
the standards are automatically captured every day, even if you have all the
URLs for each section. In addition for whatever reason it looks like a
specialized HTTP library like [requests_html], which uses a browser to execute
JavaScript before rendering the DOM's content, is unable to retrieve the
content. I discovered all this because I was considering pointing an instance of
[diffengine] at the Community Rules, but quickly realized it wouldn't work,
without a significant amount of custom coding.

I might be reading between the lines a little bit too much, but it appears that
Facebook's choice of deployment for the Community Rules greatly inhibits the
level of transparency and accountability to which they can be held. Not only is
there no real way to track how these rules are changing, they appear to be
engineered in such a way to prevent them from easily being tracked. This is in
stark contrast to organizations like GitHub, [Tumblr] (thanks [Tarleton]) and
Wikimedia (Mediawiki embraces version history) who want to share detailed
information about how their policies are changing.

It seems to me that version histories for these community documents are a
*required* foundation for building online communities. I hope that future
Content Moderation at Scale events (and I do hope there will be more) can
address this issue. It seems like a natural fit for a room full of lawyers and
legal nerds, right? Also, another bit of unsolicited advice, maybe lose the cute
session where everyone pretends to get their hands dirty in content moderation,
and use the additional time for actual, unmoderated Q&amp;A.
