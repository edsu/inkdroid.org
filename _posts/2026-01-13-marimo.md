I learned about [Marimo] a few months ago from [this podcast episode] and have been meaning to try it out. As a long time user of [Jupyter notebooks] I was interested to hear how Marimo was built (in part) to help solve the problem of [reproducibility] in data science and research software [@Pimentel:2019]. This is a problem I have had a lot of experience with, especially when sharing Jupyter notebooks with others.

The key thing that Marimo brings to the Python notebook to improve reproducibility is *reactive* execution. Marimo uses the Python [AST] to remember what cells depend on other cells, and when a change in one requires the execution of another, it will go and update it for you. Because of how they are created and edited, it's very common for Jupyter notebooks to get into an inconsistent state because of the order in which cells are executed. This problem goes away with Marimo.

But, this aside, I thought I'd mention some somewhat superficial things that I immediately liked about Marimo...bearing in mind I've only been using it for one day.

- Pandas dataframes appear as nicely formatted tables that can be easily scrolled horizontally, without truncation of values, or elided columns. I've gotten this to work in Jupyter notebooks in the past, but it always requires some fiddling it seems, and Marimo does it out of the box.
- Table columns are sortable, filterable and can be summarized.
- You can page through large tables. 
- You can easily download tables
- You can commit your notebook to a git repository, and diffs in pull requests make sense.
- You can easily run the notebook from the command line.
- You can embed tests in your notebooks, and run them separately.
- Built in basic charts (pie, bar, line, etc) which you can view source for and hand craft if you want (seems to use [Altair]).

Anyway just a few things I liked. If you use and like Jupyter notebooks I recommend giving it a try.
