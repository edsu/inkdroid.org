I am a software developer and data scientist with over two decades of
experience designing, developing, maintaining and analyzing information
infrastructures. I work best at the boundaries between the disciplines, and
specialize in the application of both qualitative and quantitative methods to
accelerate the work of research teams who work with the web as data.
