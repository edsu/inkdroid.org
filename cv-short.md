I am a recovering software developer with two decades of experience working at
the intersection of libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I study and work
with the Web as a sociotechnical system, with a particular eye to its evolving
architecture and practices of curation and preservation. I also help to keep the
lights on at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities.
