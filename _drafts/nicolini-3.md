Chapter 3 takes a look at the work of two twentieth century thinkers who are
emblematic of the turn to practice: [Anthony Giddens] and [Pierre Bourdieu].

Giddnens is one of the most influential sociologists of the 20th century.  His
idea of structuration draws on the work of [Marx], [Weber] and [Durkheim]. Originally I was going to focus on specifically on structuration in my independent 
study, but decided in the end that it might be more useful to focus on the
practice theory angle, which conceptually ties together Giddens work with the
work of other folks. 

The idea of structuration is to resolve dualist issues related to subjectivity
and objectivity using a [recursive] model of society in which practices are
defined in terms of actors, rules and resources.

* **actors**: the producers of activity, who draw on rules and resoures
* **rules**: generalized procedures for action, not to be confused with 
  instructions or prohibitions (Wittgenstein)
* **resources**: the ways in which power, or the ability to mobilize people, is
  manifested (Marx)

Nicolini uses language as an example. Spoken language and the rules of language
mutually constitute themselves. Spoken language is based on rules of language,
but the rules of language would not exist without being enacted in spoken
language

Giddens: characteristics of activity (p. 46)

Activity is also always situated in place and time. Seems like a no-brainer, but
I guess the point is that those times and places are significant in a Marxist
kinda way (materiality).

Practical and discursive conciousness. 

Practices are interdependent -- they rely on each other.

Could Giddens' rules be comparable to algorithms? Who follows the rules in
either case? Could people using technologies that embody alogorthmic rules be
thought of as following the rules? Or does the level of indirection break that.
When the algorithms break, they become visible, kind of like infrastructure.

I wonder if the controversy involving adaptive structuration theory is centered
around whether the rules can be written down:

DeSanctis, G., and M. S. Poole. 1994. Capturing the complexity in advanced
technology use: Adaptive structuration theory. Organization Science:121-147

I also wonder if focusing on the site of practice provides a way out of some of
this controversy about the application of structuration theory?

Uptake of Giddens was low, because of rise of postmodernism at the same time,
which eschewed the theory building that Giddens was doing. They were also tired
of the conservative implications of his system. (p. 50)

His work was also highly theoretical, and difficult to put into practice.

He actively dissuaded people from using his concepts in their own research! WTF?
It was to be used as sensitizing principles (could read @Giddens:1991 for more).

Giddens resisted the idea that material artifacts could be structural resources.
This seems rather odd, and perhaps at odds with ANT.

@Orlikowski:1992 introduced the use of Structuration Theory but in
@Orlikowski:2000 she moved away from it, towards practice theory. These might be
useful to read.

Bourdieu

Representing practice is not enough (anthropology) the practice needs to be
explained (sociology). Is this the strong/weak distinction?

habitus helps get around the problems of objectivism and subjectivisme. I feel
like uunderstnading objectivism as Nicolini describes it, would involve more
reading, especially Levi-Strauss and the Structuralists.

habitus isn't a way of understanding the world -- it's more a way of being in
the world

habitus relates to the body, in ways that are similar to Merleau-Ponty's ideas
of schema and habit as well as Polanyi's idea of personal tacit knowledge.
Schema and habit in particular really remind me a bit of Dewey's ideas about
norms. Schema is compared to the feeling of driving a car where the car is an
extension of the body's corporeal schema. It's only where that meshing breaks
down that the schema is noticed. Again breakdown plays an important role. It
seems like this meshing is the content domain of HCI.

Tacit knowledge was used by Polyani to explain how scientists work. Explicit
knowledge is traditional scientific knowledge exemplified by the scientific
method. But tacit knowledge is an awareness of knowing how to do something that
defies analytical description. "We know much more than we know we know."

    (habitus * capital) + field = practice

capital is anything rare and worthy of being sought after. can be material and
symbolic. symbolic capitol in particular sustains domination, because it
includes the power to name, and renders the entire process invisible.

fields are domains or structured spaces in which the distribution of capital is
disputed.

habitus is a group phenomenon. 

@Lau:2004 cited quite a bit for distinguishing and criticizing these ideas --
which might be useful to read.

ways of studying practice: (or what not to do)

* need to participate in "daily endeavors". need to live, not represent. also
  need to dismantle or side step the power relation of the Academy over the
  practitioner

* providing a description of practice is not enough. you need to describe how
  the practices are propagated and work together. 

reflexivity if important to Bourdieu -- since he saw how his own work was itself
problematic because of the way that it theorized capital in metaphysical terms.

Michel De Certau criticizes Bourdieu's split theoretical personality, and points
to levels of pratices: dominant ones that are organized by institutions and many
minor ones that operate as micro-tactices of resistance, local deformations, and
reinvention.

Nicolini sees Bourdieu's idea of habitus as not accounting for practices, and
suggests that perhaps the very idea of trying to theorize practices is at the
heart of the problem. The solution is the problem. Habitus is self
contradictory: it says that practices are historically and socially contingent,
but operates at a theoretical level that are outside place and time.

He fails to account for change (only reproduction), mediation (technology), and
reflexivity as part of practice.
