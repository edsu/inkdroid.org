Here are some things we were supposed to keep in mind for this week's readings:

* What problem or research question does it address? Is that an important problem/question?
* What is the research contribution?
* Is the overall research approach used (e.g., lit survey, interview study, experiment) appropriate?
* Are there any threats to the validity of the research? For example, the sampling method was for the researcher to ask all their friends to participate (let's hope we don't see this!).
* Is the research properly grounded in past work?
* Are there any presentation issues?
