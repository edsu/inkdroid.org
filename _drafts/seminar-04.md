Notes from class:

A Hierarchy of Design Complexity: Bill Moggridge, Designing Interactions 
* Anthropemetrics, Physiology, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Ecology

- Visibility: make controls (signifier) visible
- Affordance
- Ben Schneiderman's Design Principles

Distinction between usability and user experience. 
* Functional not necessarily FUNctional (Jonathan)

Raskin: Humane Interface

Surprised that nobody seemed to like Norman :/

Keystroke Model: based on expert users ; Experiment, Model ; limited

Writing Strategies:
* illustrations are important, captions are important
* formulas as visualization
* subheadings to make things easier for the reader
* start a section with the main point, so people can find their way back
* template, protocol for experimentation: group study
* goal is sometimes to help people replicate
* need a clear method: this is a must
* need to be able to justify the decision
* supplementary information (datasets, interview transcripts, coding, etc)
* talk about failure
* made clear real world implications
* in first paragraph that the research is important
* reflection on findings

Get started writing:
* look for similar papers: content & venue
* keep track of good examples of papers
* may find some that work as templates
* talk about the paper, get feedback all along the way ; talk to co-authors
* talk to the people that you are citing
* start with what's easiest: sometimes lit review, or methods, depending
* what is the story: what do you want people to remember, how do they get highlighted ; the turns
* where do you like writing?
* find your voice, style, etc.
* give yourself time
* the time of day, and stretches of time
* plan/outline
* be clear and concise
* use evidence

### Here are some things we were supposed to keep in mind for this week's readings:

* What problem or research question does it address? Is that an important problem/question?
* What is the research contribution?
* Is the overall research approach used (e.g., lit survey, interview study, experiment) appropriate?
* Are there any threats to the validity of the research? For example, the sampling method was for the researcher to ask all their friends to participate (let's hope we don't see this!).
* Is the research properly grounded in past work?
* Are there any presentation issues?

@Norman:2013, Chapter 1

* Psychopathology: the scientific study of mental disorders, and their causes (potentially in the environment)
* Is it possible to learn how a product is *supposed* to be used?
* "All artificial things are designed."
* Types: Industrial, Interaction, Experience (last two seem to blend a bit)
* Rules followed by a machine are only know by its designers -- and sometimes not even then (Nick's work on Algorithmic Accountability)
* The importance of blaming machines for the problems, not the person. Human centered.
* "If only people would read the instructions everything would be all right." Haha: RTFM.
* Wow, he studied the usability of a nuclear reactor and Three Mile Island. No pressure!
* Need to design for the way people *are* not the way you (the designer) want them to be.
* In Human Centered Design (HCD) focus on breakdown, not on when things are going right. Winograd & Flores (Computers and Cognition).
* HCD cuts across the three types of design.
* Affordances: relationship between a physical object and a person (or agent). An affordance is not a property of the object, it is a relationship.
    * [J J Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Gibson) came up with the word.
    * Some are perceivable, and some are invisible.
* Norman introduces: affordances, signinfiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and conceptual model.
* Signifiers are signals that draw attention to affordances, or make them visible.
    - They can be accidental or unintentional. Markers of use (a path through the woods)
    - Some signifiers are the perceived affordances, useful in cases where the affordance isn't easily perceived.
    - They *must* be perceivable, or else they are failing to function.
    - Some perceived affordances (signifiers) can appear real, but are not. (used in games, and other places to illustrate constraints?)
    - If signifiers are signals for affordances, I guess affordances are the signified?
* Mappings: a relationship between the control and the result. 
    - some are natural, some feel natural (but in fact are not)
* Feedback communicates the results of an action: there can be too little feedback, and too much feedback (backseat driver).
* Conceptual models are explanations of how something works. Often they are simplified, and there are more than one. They are often inferred from using a device.
* System Image: the bundle of all these things -- akin to an actual brand?
* Hardest part of design is getting people to abandon their disciplinary viewpoint and to think about the person who is using the device (antidisciplinarity)

@Crystal:2004

* This paper is a review of the literature on the topic of task analysis, with a view to the future, so not so much a formal research study really.
* It seems like a pretty thorough review, but wondering if it is a regurgitation of Kuutti and Bannon (1991) that is mentioned in the conclusion. Although I guess Crystal reviews content past 1991, so maybe it's an update of sorts?
* It's kind of amusing how they use their own task analysis breakdown to present the illustration of the field. I guess this would be a conceptual model (CTA)?
* My impression was that more could've been done to define notion of *usability* which is thrown in at the end.
* I liked how they wanted to compose and integrate the research on task-analysis, and not validate a particular viewpoint, but show the options that are available, and suggest cross-pollination between the models. Not sure if this is inter-disciplinary or not.

@Oulasvirta:2003

* conclusions are inconclusive
* hypotheses are introduced too late
* good grounding in the literature
* they seemed to have tow different variables at play: documentation provided and environment
* admittedly limited analysis of the design documents

@Jackson:2015

I brought this as an example of what I thought was a well written paper. I liked it because it was pretty strongly grounded in enthographic research (admittedly something I want to learn more about), and in a topic area that I liked; ecology, measurement and standards. I thought the paper did a good job of studying the phenomena at different scales: the individual team of researchers out in the field, and the large scale national collection of data. I thought it was also very interesting how they presented standards as things that we should consider as a design vector in Human Computer Interaction. The very idea that seemingly invisible and dull things like standards (how they live, and what they omit) could be useful in design is a fascinating idea to me. I liked the illustration that while measuring the environment seems like a precise science, it has a human/social component to it that is extremely important. Finally, I'll admit it: I brought the paper because it won an honorable mention best paper award at CHI -- and I'm a fan of Jackson's work.
