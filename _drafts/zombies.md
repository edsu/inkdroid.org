One of the readings this week for INST800 was [@Bates:2007]. It's a short piece that outlines how she and Mary Maack organized their work on the third edition of the [Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences]. When creating an encyclopedia it becomes immediately necessary to define the scope, so you have some hope of finishing the work. As she points out, information science is contested territory now because of all the money and power that is aggregated in Silicon Valley. Everyone wants a piece of that now ; whereas it struggled to be a discipline before.

> We have been treated as the astrologers and phrenologists of modern scienceâ€” assumed to be desperately trying to cobble together the look of scholarship in what are surely trivial and nearly content-free disciplines.

So, in large part Bates and Maack needed to define what information science is before they could get to work. But Bates felt like this theory transcended its use to scope the work, and really did define the field. What better way to establish the ideological foundations of a field than write an encyclopedia about it?

A few things struck me about this article. The small addition of "s" to the end of the title of the encyclopedia seemed like an important detail. It recognizes the pluralistic nature of information, how it has grown out of many disciplines across the humanities, social sciences and physical sciences. But she goes on to point out that in fact all these disciplines do have something in common:

>  ... we engage in living and working our daily lives, and these vast numbers of human activities give off or throw off a remarkably extensive body of documentation of one sort or another: Business records, family histories, scholarly books, scientific and technical journals, websites, listservs and blogs for groups with common interests of a work or avocational nature, religious texts, educational curricula, x-rays, case records in law, medicine, and criminal justice, architectural drawings and purchase orders from construction sites, and on and on and on. **The universe of living throws off documentary products, which then form the universe of documentation**.

This description of different universes is compelling for me because it seems to recognize the processes and systems that information is a part of. She also includes a quirky mindmap-like diagram of these two universes in interaction which helps illustrate what she sees going on:

Now I would be sold if things stopped here, but of course they don't. Bates goes on to criticize Briet's idea of documents (anything that can be used as evidence) in order to say:

>I argue that a document, above all, contains "recorded information," that is, "communicatory or memorial information preserved in a durable medium". [@Bates:2006].

For bates the antelope in the zoo is a specimen, not a document. Now I should probably dig down into [@Bates:2006] to understand fully what's going on here, but this definition on the surface seems specific, but begs a few questions. Who or what is in communication? Is understanding required for it to be communication? Does this communication need to be intentional? What is does durable mean, over what time scales? Maybe I'm just getting defensive because I've always been a bit partial to Briet's definition. 

Bates goes on to use this distinction as an argument for not including the study of living things as information in the encyclopedia; which implies she doesn't see them as information at all.
