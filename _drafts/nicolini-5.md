In Chapter 5 Nicolini takes a look at how practice theories have been informed
by [activity theory]. Activity theory was pioneered by the psychologist [Lev
Vygotsky] in the 1920s and 1930s. Since Vygotsky activity theory has grown and
evolved in a variety of directions that are all characterized by the attention
to the role of objects and an attention to the role of conflict or dialectic in
human activity. Nicolini focuses specifically on *cultural and historical
activity theory* which focuses on practice and has been picked up by the
organization and management studies.

Things start off by talking about Marx again, specifically the description of
work in [Das Kapital], where work is broken up into a set of interdependent
components:

1. the worker
2. the material upon which the worker works
3. the instruments used to carry out the work
4. the actions of the worker
5. the goal towards which the worker works
6. the product of the work

The identity of the worker is a net effect of this process. Vygotsky and other
activity theorists took these rough categories and refined them. Vygotsky in
particular focused attention on *mediation*, or how we as humans typically
interact with our environments using cultural artifacts (things designed by
people) and that language itself was an example of such an artifact. These
artifacts transform the person using them, and the environment: workers are
transformed by their tools.

Instead of focusing on individual behavior, activity theorists often examine how
actions are materially situated at various levels: actions, activities and
operations which are a function of thinking about the collective effort
involved. This idea was introduced by @Leontev:1978. @Kuutti:1996 is cited a few
times, which is interesting because @Kuutti:2014 is how I found out about
Nicolini in the first place (small world).  To illustrate the various levels
[Leont'ev] has an example of using the gears in a car with manual transmission,
and how a person starts out performing the individual actions of shifting gears
as they learn, but eventually they become automatic operations that are
performed without much thinking during other activities such speeding up,
stopping, going up hills, etc. The operations can also be dismantled and
reassembled and recomposed to create new actions. I'm reminded of [push
starting] my parent's VW Bug when the battery was dead. The example of manual
transmission is particularly poignant because of the prevalence of automatic
cars today, where those shifting actions have been subsumed or embodied in the
automatic transmission. The actions can no longer be decomposed, at least not by
most of us non-mechanics. It makes me wonder briefly about the power dynamics
are embodied in that change.

It wasn't until @Engestrom:1987 that the focus came explicitly to bear on the
social. Yrjö Engeström (who is referenced and linked in Wikipedia but there is
not an article for him yet) is credited for starting the influential
Scandinavian activity theory strand of work, and helping bring it to the West.
The connection to Scandinavia makes me think about participatory design which
came from that region, and what connections there are between it and activity 
theory. Also [action research] seems similarly inflected, but perhaps it's more
of a western rebranding? At any rate Engeström got people thinking about an
activity *system* which Nicolini describes as a "collective, systemic,
object-oriented formation", which is summarized with this diagram:

This makes me wonder if there might be something in this conceptual diagram 
from Engeström for me to use in analyzing my interviews with web archivists.
It's kind of strange to run across this idea of *object-oriented* again outside
of the computer science context. I can't help but wonder how much cross-talk
there was between psychology/sociology and computer science. The phrase is also
being deployed in humanistic circles with the focus on [object oriented
ontology], which is a philosophy of decentering the human. It's kind of ironic
given how object-oriented programming has fallen out of favor a bit in software
development, with a resurgence of interest in functional programming. But
functions can be objects, but then there is the post-functionalism move, 
so...but I digress, completely.

This is where Cultural and Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) come in, which is
concerned with the ways in which objects are both socially and objectively
constructed. It seems like an attempt at a middle path between social sciences
and the physical sciences. This focus on the *material* and where it intersects
with the social is something I really like about this line of thought coming
from Marx. It's interesting that Nicolini uses the phrase "bite back" here to
talk about how objects can affect us as well. I seem to remember running across
this idea in some of [Ian Bogost]'s work but I can't place it right now. It's an
interesting phrase that might be fun to follow in the literature. Anyway CHAT is
a relatively recent formulation (relative to activity theory) and credited to
@Miettinen:2005. It seems like a useful thing to follow up on in the context of
my Web archiving study because I do need a way to talk about the material of the
archive, the archival system, the Web and the people working with it
(archivists, researchers, etc)--and I'm not sure I can come up with it myself.
