In the final chapter of *Practice theory, work, and organization* Nicolini
concludes by presenting his own approach to practice theory, which he calls a
*toolkit* approach:

>  I am not interested in proposing a new theory of practice. Instead, I will
>  embrace a different strategy that can be described as a form of programmatic
>  eclecticism or, more simply, a toolkit approach. My main tenet is that to
>  study practice empirically we are better served by a strategy based on
>  deliberately switching between theoretical sensitivities. (p. 213)

> In short, the toolkit approach that I advocate here responds to the principle
> that the aim of social science is to provide a richer and more nuanced
> understanding of the world, and not to offer simplified answers to complex
> questions. More clearly, good social science makes the world more complex, not
> simpler. Thicker, not thinner, descriptions are the aim of good social
> science.  And so it should be in the attempt to understand practices. (p. 215)
