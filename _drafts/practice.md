> Practice theories do not locate the origin of the social in the mind,
> discourse, or interaction, but in 'practices' - routines consisting of a
> number of interconnected and inseparable elements: physical and mental
> activities of human bodies, the material environment, artifacts and their use,
> contexts, human capabilities, affinities and motivation.  *Practices are
> wholes*, whose existence is dependent on the temporal interconnection of all
> these elements, and cannot be reduced to, or explained by, any one single
> element.

> From a practices perspective the world is a network of performances that are
> durable, because the ways of doing things are coded in minds, bodies,
> artifacts, objects and texts, and connected together so that the result of
> performing one activity serves as a resource for another.
