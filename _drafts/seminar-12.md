This week we were visted by [Elisabeth Bonsignore], who is a PhD student in the iSchool studying transmedia storytelling. The readings we had included [@Kim:2009], [@Gurzick:2011], [@Bonsignore:2012] and Diane led a discussion about
[@Marciano:2013].

The first half of the class was led by Elisabeth. She walked us through some of
the transmedia storytelling projects that she has worked on for the past few
years with colleagues such as Kari Kraus and June Ahn. They were all examples of
something called Alternative Reality Games (ARGs).
