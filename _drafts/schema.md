Andrea's advice that it's important to write down initial ideas about the schema
because it is likely to change as the schema is tested, and it can be difficult
to remember why initial decisions were made. Being able to contrast what was
learned through coding, with what was expected/assumed at the beginning can
provide valuable insights.
