Chapter 4 focuses on the idea of practice as something that is tied to tradition
and community, which is something Nicolini sees Giddens and Bourdieu departing
from. Nicolini is presenting this chapter mostly in order to critique the idea,
because its focus on people transmitting ideas to each, when left unexamined,
tends to give solidity to social actors and groups:

> I will argue that while a coherent theory of learning and transmission is 
> a requisite element of any theory of practice, there is a fine balance to 
> be struck between recognizing that all practices need to be recognized 
> by a group of practitioners, and the reification of such a collective 
> into a social body that exists independently ofthe practice. (p. 78)

Socialization (family and schooling) is important to the work of Durkheim, who
influenced Giddens. Apprenticeship is another concept that has been used to
explain how practices are transmitted--but it requires the master/pupil power
dynamic, and hence the acceptance of inequality of social positions. It is also
more limited in that it is focused primarily on learned skills of craftsmen or
artists.

Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) is a term introduced by @Lave:1991
that attempts to take apprenticeship out of the particular historical 
environments (the craftsman's shop) and explain apprenticeship as a learning 
process. They do this by making it essential that the learner take
responsibility for the thing the thing they are doing -- this is what makes it a
practice. Nicolini cites Foucault in pointing out that this acceptance of
responsibility also means an acceptance of the social order and power dynamics
present in it.

Apparently @Lave:1991 gave rise to many ethnographic studies of [situated
learing], that loked at learning as a social phenomena rather than something
that happens inside someone's head.
