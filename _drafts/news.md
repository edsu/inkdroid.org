A post about how news.stanford.edu had to remove pre-2016 content because of accessibility changes. 

Questions about accessibility guidelines and whether web archives have been granted an exemption, which only makes sense right?

Ben O'Brien at NLNZ let us know about: https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/nz-government-web-standards/web-accessibility-standard-1-1/

Andy Jackson noted that UKWA has this language: https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/info/accessibility_statement/#non-accessible-content

How many pages are we talking about that were captured pre-2016 in swap.stanford.edu. It should be possible to sort through the results of the CDX API? How does that compare to what is in the Internet Archive?

Questions about redirecting to web archives, the case of ssw.stanford.edu.
