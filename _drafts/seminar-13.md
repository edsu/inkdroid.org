This week we looked at accessible technology design with our professor, Leah Findlater. Leah has done a pretty amazing job of remaining as neutral as possible to the topic of conversation each week, which isn't easy to do without sacrificing vigorous discussion. So it was great to hear her present about a research area she is directly involved in, and cares deeply about. As usual we read three papers: @Shinohara:2011, @Bigham:2010 and @Anthony:2013.
