Prospectus

Suggested wording (roughly) from Ricky:

Look at the literature in three areas:

1. Sociotechnical theory
2. Archival Appraisal
3. Software Studies

Learn how to look at the work of appraisal in web archives.

Where does the Data Visualization class fit in here? Or should I do the STS class, since it would inform 1?

Areas to focus on:
- appraisal connect with DocNow work
- attention: appraisal as archival attention
- memory: Mediated Memories (Van Dijk)
- memory: cognitive science (Kohonen)
- Collective memory: Rickyâ€™s article
- sharing: why do people share
- participatory archives
- software studies: archival software (Kelly)
- Archivists as users
- Habermas (publics) / Booms (Society)
- technology of appraisal (look at how tech has impacted appraisal in the past)
- standards
- archivists as users

Think about shifting focus from appraisal to standards, specifically the development of the WARC standard alongside the development of Web standards. Leverage standards work of Star, Russell, Finn.
