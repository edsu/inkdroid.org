I recently finished [Richard Powers]' [Playground], which is a lot of things, but very much a meditation on the near-future (or perhaps present) of [Large Language Models] like ChatGPT, and how they fit into our culture and politics. I won't give away any spoilers (it is worth a read!), but one moment has been echoing in my head due to things going on at work, so I thought I'd write it down to get it out of my head.

Near the end of the novel a group of people living on the island of [Makatea] are trying to decide whether they want to accept a proposal from a consortium of corporations to develop, and thus greatly transform, their island home. Only 50 or so people live on the island, and they have decided to vote on it.

In order to help the Makateans decide how to vote the consortium has provided them with access to a 3rd generation Large Language Model called Profunda, which operates much like ChatGPT. Users can engage with in conversation using their voice, and inquire about how the development will impact the island. Profunda has access to materials related to the consortium and its detailed plans. It was built on top of a foundation model that was assembled from a massive harvest of content from the World Wide Web.

<blockquote>
"I don’t know how to vote. I don’t even know who this consortium is! People always say, ‘Follow the money.’ I’m supposed to vote this up or down, without even knowing who exactly is paying for this pilot program or what they stand to gain by this . . . seasteading."

Pockets of applause followed the comment, suggesting that the priest was not the only one still at sea.

Manutahi Roa was baffled by the objection. He waved a dossier of printouts in the air. "You should have asked Profunda. I did!"

"But how can I trust him?" the priest shouted back. "The consortium made him!"

Neria Tepau, the postmistress, shot to her feet. "Exactly! We should have been researching for ourselves, these last ten days. We have phones. We have a cell tower. We can search every web page in the world. Instead, we’re relying on this construction, this . . . thing to spoon-feed us!"

"Neria!" Wen Lai’s objection sounded tired. "A search engine spoon-feeds us, too."

"So letting this thing do the work and making a biased summary is somehow better than me going through the pages myself?"

Hone Amaru laughed. "This thing has read a hundred billion pages. How many can you read, in ten days?"

"It’s the ten days that is the crime! We’re being railroaded!" The words cracked in Puoro’s throat. Patrice put his arm around his partner’s shoulders.

The Queen stood up and the room settled down. "People. Friends. Sisters. Brothers. We’re letting the Popa’ā make us as crazy as they are!"

This observation was met by near-universal applause. Even the mayor collected himself and clapped.

**"It’s easy," the Queen went on. "We ask who is paying. It tells us. And then, as Madame Martin would say, we check its work" She looked to the schoolteacher, who held both her thumbs high in the air. The assembly broke into a new round of applause.**

When the cheers settled, the mayor said, "Profunda. Please give us short biographies for the five biggest investors in this seasteading consortium."
