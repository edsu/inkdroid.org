title: First Lecture

A little over a year ago I left a comfortable job working as a federal employee at the Library of Congress to start a new career working as a software developer at the University of Maryland. One of the big reasons for the change was that it also allowed me to enroll in the iSchool PhD program while working in the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH).

A few months ago, while out walking my dog one evening, I ran into one of my neighbors who (after a bit of light conversation) asked me why I was doing a PhD. He had a PhD himself, and had just left 20 years of academic life to work in a consulting business. He was curious why I would be going back to school now, and wondered if it would open doors in my career that were currently closed. In a way he caught me off guard. I thought it was obvious why someone would do a PhD -- to continue to invest in learning from other people, in a field that you are interested in. But I found it difficult to articulate an answer at the time. I'd like to use this space here to describe a bit about why I decided to make this change. But since I'm kind of a non-traditional student I feel like I need to explain where I've been in order to do that.

This semester we read Randy Pausch's Last Lecture. In it Pausch describes a set of his childhood dreams, how he achieved them, and some of the valuable lessons he learned along the way. I know I can't live up to his presentation here. He learned so many things, and presented them with such effortless insight, humor and (remarkable) joy. The imminent end of his life, seemed to bring his dreams into poignant clarity.

I wanted to start with Pausch to bookmark the deceptively simple idea of having personal aspirations, and what can happen sometime when you attain them. In many ways Pausch's Last Lecture is a perfect example of a most American phenomenon: actualizing personal dreams. One of his childhood dreams was to become an Imagineer at Disney. When he graduated with his PhD he immediately dashed off job letters to Disney, and was promptly (and politely) turned down. But he didn't take these letters as a rejection. He continued to try to find a way to work there. Eventually through various hijinks he landed a job working with the Aladdin virtual reality project team at Disney, and his experience working there radically transformed his professional career.

He was able to get around, over or under the various brick walls that were put in his way. But telling the story of the American dream achieved, entails the story of all those dreams that are deferred, the dreams denied, the dreams dismantled, the dreams that are broken, and forgotten.

It may sound strange but working at the Library of Congress was my equivalent of Pausch's Imagineer dream. This dream took shape early on in grammar and highschool in the enjoyment I found in reading books and using computers. Yes, I was a big nerd. Here's a copy of Lord of the Rings I read and reread when I was in 5th grade.

And here's a picture of the first computer I really ever got to use a lot (I had dabbled on some others like a TRS-80, BasicFour and ZX-81):

OK, technically my Dad owned it. He bought it for doing word processing with WordPerfect and spreadsheets with VisiCalc. Fortunately for me he was generous and trusting enough to let me use it to play games that my friends were trading, and to run BASIC programs I had copied out of magazines like Nibble and SoftTalk. Later in high school I used this computer to write Pascal programs to complete homework in my computer science class. I was very lucky, and in fact privileged, to go to a school that had a computer science class in the 1980s, and to have a personal computer at home to do homework on -- hold that thought for a moment, I'm going to return to it.

As a junior in highschool I filled what I seem to remember being a multiple choice scantron style application to Rutgers University (the State University of New Jersey), and the next year discovering that I was admitted to the College of Engineering. I spent a year in the engineering program and quickly switched to the liberal arts college where I studied philosophy, then computer science, and finally graduated (miraculously) in 4 years with a degree in English and American Literature. Which qualified me to do very little in the recession of the early 1990s in a country that was at war in Iraq.

So I took my degree in English and my few possessions and moved to England. I was able to get an English passport (because I was born there) which allowed me to work at a series of random jobs: in a University cafeteria, as a photographic studio, operating a deep fryer in a fish and chips shop, making pizzas, and polishing floors in a hospital. I traveled around to Wales and Scotland, sleeping in tents and on beaches, traveling with friends and sometimes alone, hitchhiking, and on buses and trains. I settled in Brighton for a bit, and was able to rent a small room in a building by the sea. After three years I began to miss the optimism and pragmatism of the United States. This time was really important to me, because it taught me how culture influences how we think.

I returned to New Jersey and worked in a used bookstore for a couple years. This paid barely enough to survive, but I enjoyed selling books and stocking the shelves, and accepting donations much more than polishing the floor in a hospital. The husband of one of my coworkers was a computer hobbyist, who introduced me to Archie, Gopher, Veronica and Jughead, which were early ways of navigating the Internet. I had had a little exposure to the Internet back in high school when we would dial into CompuServe--but this felt much more grassroots and interesting. I was convinced to take my interest in computing and books and go back to Rutgers University to study Library and Information Science (LIS).

This was now the early part of the 1990s and the World Wide Web was just emerging. I worked in the libraries at Rutgers University and Columbia University while finishing my Masters degree. One of my jobs was to enter in metadata for dissertations using greenscreen terminals to enter in Machine Readable Cataloging data [MARC]. Another was to work on a reference desk to help researchers use a database called RLIN to simultaneously search the catalogs of research libraries in New York City. This was kind of a big deal even then, but all this was about to change.

I had access to computer labs that provided unlimited access to the Internet, where I could experiment with HTML, web browsers and servers. Being able to view the HTML source, copy and paste, and learn by experimentation was really empowering. I created a few toy websites for class assignments at the time, where we learned about hypermedia and virtual spaces like MOOs and MUDs. But largely my classes were still focused on traditional libraries, not on the information spaces that were being built right under our noses on the Internet. I knew the Web and the Internet was fun and exciting, but at the time I didn't grasp its significance with respect to what I was learning about information studies.

Before I graduated the Rutgers LIS Student Club spent an afternoon driving down to Washington DC to visit the National Agriculture Library and the Library of Congress. I remember being blown away by the size, scope and stateliness of these institutions. The Library of Congress was and still is the largest library in the world. Around that time they were knee deep in digitizing portions of its collections to be put on the Internet to be part of the American Memory website.

I remember wanting to work at the Library of Congress then and applying for jobs there and never hearing anything back. I sent out what felt like hundreds of hundreds of resumes and cover letters to all kinds of libraries around the United States. I resorted to experimenting with the type of paper it was printed on thinking that would make a difference. In the end I received one offer for a two year job working as academic resident librarian at the University of Illinois (UIUC). This job later led to a position as a metadata librarian at Old Dominion University (ODU). Although these were explicitly librarian jobs, in both I found myself using my computer hobby skills to help bring services onto the Web.

For example at UIUC I helped maintain a database of video and music holdings available on the Web. Doesn't this sound so quaint now? ODU was a Federal Depository Library, so they had thousands of records for government documents in their online catalog. Many of these records had URLs in them, since the Government Publications Office was beginning to publishing documents on the Internet. Unfortunately there wasn't much awareness about the damage of broken links at the time, so we (or really I) needed to periodically check the URLs and fix them.

It didn't take long doing this by hand before I was learning a programming language called Perl, to easily extract the URLs from the bibliographic records, and automatically check them to see if they were broken. I also used this experience processing MARC data to help the University of Virginia distribute and customize catalog records for the holdings of their Electronic Text Center. This allowed people to look for books in their local catalog and notice that it was online on the Web, whereas previously it might have only been available via inter-library-loan. This was a newish idea at the time: the Web was allowing the library to be a publisher.

To do this work I needed to understand the format of the MARC record, pictured above. Now this wasn't exactly rocket science, but it did require a particular attention to detail, and patience in reading technical specifications to understand how to parse and serialize the format properly. One thing this experience really highlighted for me was the value in making these technical specifications for data standards openly available on the Web for free. One of the reasons why the Web was able to expand was because of the open source software community that was undergirding it, and still keeps it going today. It was easy to find user groups for different computer languages to learn about them. Some evenings I would drive the three hours up to DC just to attend a meeting of the SGML Users Group, or the DC Perl Mongers meetings. These meetups taught me a lot about how important socializing was to technical work.

I ended up designing my MARC processing software so that it could be reused by other people who needed to automate MARC data processing, and made it available to any one in the world with an Internet connection by uploading it to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). I interacted with people all around the world who wanted to use it, or modify it. I got to hear stories of what they were doing. It was kind of mind blowing to tap into this community of hackers and creators all around the world who were helping to build the Web.

I also realized around this time that I could make almost three times as much money if I moved to New York City to work at a .com. In New York I got to learn a lot more about designing software as a part of a team and data processing in high traffic environments. I was the fourth (or was it fifth) employee in a startup to bring company newsletter publishing onto the Web. Of course the pressures of the .com bubble in 2000 morphed the company into full on email marketing, which wasn't exactly my cup of tea. And then this happened:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkdroid/23458305042/in/dateposted/"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wtc.jpg"></a>

I was working just a few blocks from the World Trade Center when it came crashing down, and the world came crashing in. Kesa (my girlfriend) and I left New York to live in a rural town near the Wisconsin border in northern Illinois. We got married. I went back to working with books at a book distribution company that had a big warehouse, and which also had business processes built around that MARC format I had worked with previously. We used the open source software I helped to create while at ODU to create an application for librarians to see gaps in their collections, and easily bulk order new books for their schools to fill those gaps. Chloe and Graham were born.

I started applying what I had learned about MARC to other programming languages like Ruby and Python. I began to implement other technical standards such as the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU), and the Common Query Language (CQL) kind of because it was useful at work, but also because it kind of like a puzzle or building a model. It led to some interesting side work here and there. With a few friends I helped form an informal community for software developers and designers who worked in libraries called [code4lib]. code4lib started a conference in Corvallis, Oregon and the conference is celebrating its 10 year anniversary this February in Philadelphia.

Around that time I got an email out of the blue from someone looking for contractors to help build a digital repository team at the Library of Congress. One thing I forgot to mention earlier is that the MARC standard that I had written software for was developed by Henrietta Avram at the Library of Congress during the 1960s. The OAI-PMH standard I had worked with was in use at the Library of Congress to make their American Memory collection available. Those 

So we moved to the DC area eight years ago from, so that I could help build the Repository Development Center (RDC) at the Library of Congress. I began as a contractor and after a year switched over to working as a federal employee. In the RDC I worked as part of a team that designed, built, and deployed digital preservation and data curation applications. Some of the projects I had a direct hand in were:

* Chronicling America: a web application that provides public access to ten million pages of historic newspapers that are being digitized as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program
* Sampler: an internal data curation tool for performing quality assurance over digital images that were moving through our internal data repository.
* LC Linked Data Service: a Web API for making millions of records about subjects, places and people available to the public, which I prototyped while working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
* Twitter Archive: I designed and implemented the software that transferred 500 billion tweets (500 million per day) to the Library of Congress.

These projects taught me what felt like an important lesson about digital preservation, which is what we were supposed to be doing in the Repository Development Center. Digital content is being preserved only as long as it is been used. The idea of preserving digital content without using it is deeply problematic. Unfortunately, traditional paper based library and archival practices have separated these two fundamental activities to the point that different units in organizations perform them. Access can be as simple as an automated check to see that a file is still present where it is believed to be, or as complex as a user with a research question who needs access to the data and its documentation in order to use it. But if nothing is accessing the data people will forget about it being there, and it'll be easy for it to go missing, and for people to not recognize it again when it turns up again. This idea was not new, I had just recently got in tune with it (@Kirschenbaum:2013):

> … the preservation of digital objects is logically inseparable from the act of their creation – the lag between creation and preservation collapses completely, since a digital object may only ever be said to be preserved if it is accessible, and each individual access creates the object anew. 

Leaving the Library of Congress was a big deal for me and my family. I'm 46 years old, have three children, and the real or imagined security of a "permanent" job working for the US Government was a scary thing to abandon for the uncertainty of a new career. But in many ways this security had become a burden to me, and a barrier to my continued professional development. I thought I had gotten around my brick walls, only to find them within the very organization I wanted to work in for so many years.

So now you know where I've been. I'm not sure in all of this if I've adequately described why I decided to come to UMD to work in MITH and start in the iSchool PhD program. But there are some hints I've left in the way I've chosen to tell my story. Here they are in a more explicit or teased out form:

### Lifelong Learning

This is an idea that was instilled in me in graduate school by Professor David Carr. I had amazing access to learning resources at the Library of Congress. But it was hard to find a community of learners and practitioners to be part of. More and more I found that I missed having access to an environment where study and learning were explicitly valued, and cultivated.

When Ping Wang welcomed us to the iSchool PhD program one of the things he said was that we were there to learn how to think like our teachers. The world is changing too fast, and is need of new ideas too much, for me to become complacent and comfortable in my own ideas. I like to think that I have more to learn, and more people to learn from. I want to be challenged, and I want to set that example for my kids.

### Data is for Use

Collecting data without using it isn't really a good idea. If you are collecting something you can't use, maybe it's not such a good idea to collect it in the first place?. Joining the digital humanities group at MITH was an opportunity to be part of a team that was putting data to actual use, through data curation practices, to increase knowledge and broaden experience.

My experiments with things like [congressedits] that got me into a bit of hot water at the Library of Congress were welcomed, and even encouraged. This was like a breath of fresh air for me. On applying to UMD I also heard that the iSchool was opening a new Data Curation Center, which seemed like another good area that I could contribute in.

### Broken World Thinking

At some point in my last two years at the Library of Congress I felt like I became increasingly aware of how things actually got done there. Things got done not because of strategic goals, or bureaucratic mandates, rules or reports -- in fact, sometimes it felt like things got done in spite of these things, but at best they didn't interfere. No, things got done because smart people cared enough to work together to achieve particular goals. I began to notice the simple collaborations and friendships and alliances that got formed, and made things work. 

Around this time I read a paper by Steven Jackson about Broken World Thinking [@Jackson:2014]. His central insight was that it was precisely in the moments that systems, institutions, devices broke down that we have the greatest opportunities for creative design. This idea spoke to my experience with data standards, software development, and digital preservation. It was a deeply humanizing notion that draws on philosophical ideas going back to Dewey, anthropology, ethnography and more recent work from feminist thinkers on the ethics of care. I wanted to be able to dig into some of these ideas more, and study them in the context of things that I had been exposed to in my career.

Also, I've spent a lot of time working with the Web in my career. It really is an amazing piece of infrastructure that has been built, that has enabled some very important collaborative work and social change. But the Web is in a pivotal moment right now, where surveillance and systems of control and automation are threatening to warp and subvert its functioning. Some argue that the damage has already been done.

### Teaching

Learning and teaching go hand in hand. There's nothing like having to articulate and communicate a topic to a class to get you to learn it backwards and forwards. I want to learn how to teach better, and to think better, and I'm hoping that the PhD program will help me do that. I feel like I've had some experience to draw on in teaching. But what I'm lacking are some of the ways to frame this experience, and draw it out into understanding. I feel like once I get that part down I could have some to contribute as a teacher some day. My brother, Dad and wife are all teachers. There is something deeply optimistic about teaching. I think I want to be one too, but I need some help getting there.
