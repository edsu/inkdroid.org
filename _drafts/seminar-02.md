title: Seminar Week 2

Here are some more random thoughts about the seminar readings this week.

@Buckland:1991

This is another classic in the field where Buckland uses the notion of **information-as-thing** as a fulcrum for exploring what information is. I noticed on re-reading this paper that he seems to feel that information science theorists have dismissed the study of information as thing. So in some ways his article is a defense of the study of information as an object. He uses this focus on the materiality of documents to explore and delimit other aspects of information, such as how events can be viewed as information and the situational aspects of information. Early on in the paper is one of his most interesting findings, a matrix for characterizing information in terms of its tangibility and objectivity:

|              | **Intangible**    | **Tangible**           | 
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Entity**   | Knowledge         | Data                   |
| **Process**  | Becoming informed | Information processing | 

His analysis keeps returning to the centrality of information-as-thing, seemingly in an attempt to resist this dead end:

> If anything is, or might be, informative, then everything is, or might well be, information. In which case calling something “information” does little or nothing to define it. If everything is information, then being information is nothing special. (p.356)
