Here are some more random thoughts about the seminar readings this week.

@Buckland:1991

This is another classic in the field where Buckland uses the notion of **information-as-thing** as a fulcrum for exploring what information is. I noticed on re-reading this paper that he seems to feel that information science theorists have dismissed the study of information-as-thing. So in many ways this article is a defense of the study of information as an object. He uses this focus on the materiality of documents to explore and delimit other aspects of information systems, such as how events can be viewed as information and the situational aspects of information. Early on in the paper is one of his most interesting findings, a matrix for characterizing information in terms of two axes:

|              | **Intangible**    | **Tangible**           | 
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Entity**   | Knowledge         | Data                   |
| **Process**  | Becoming informed | Information processing | 

His analysis keeps returning to the centrality of information-as-thing, in an attempt to avoid this logical dead end:

> If anything is, or might be, informative, then everything is, or might well be, information. In which case calling something "information" does little or nothing to define it. If everything is information, then being information is nothing special. [@Buckland:1991 p. 356]

It seems to me that the tension here is one of economy: you can't put *everything* in the archive, things must be appraised. Buckland does note that not everything needs to be relocated into the information system to become information:

> Some informative objects, such as people and historic buildings, simply do not lend themselves to being collected, stored, and retrieved. But physical relocation into a collection is not always necessary for continued access. Reference to objects in their existing locations creates, in effect, a "virtual collection." One might also create some description or representation of them: a film, a photograph, some measurements, a directory, or a written description. What one then collects is a document describing or representing the person, building, or other object. [@Buckland:1991 p. 354]

But even in this case a reference or a representation of the thing must be created (which takes effort presumably) and it must be made part of the information system. Even in the world of *big data* and the *Internet of Things* that we live in now, the information system is not as big as the universe. Although I guess there are people like [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) who [think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science) that the universe itself is an information system. Perhaps someone like Wolfram wouldn't regard seeing everything as information as a problem.

Some of the paper seems to be defending information-as-thing a bit too strenuously, to the point that it seems like the only viable way of looking at information. So I liked that Buckland closes with this:

> It is not asserted that sorting areas of information science with respect to their relationship to information-as-thing would produce clearly distinct populations. Nor is any hierarchy of scholarly respectability intended.

 Information certainly can be considered as material, and Buckland demonstrates it's a useful lever for learning more about what information is. But considering it only as material absent information-as-process leads to some philosophical quandaries.
