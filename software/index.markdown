I write software for libraries and archives. I try to live up to at least the
former in [Release Early, Release Often][Raymond], so most of my code musings 
can be found on [GitHub]. The idea is things incubate there, and if they ever 
become anything more than a plaything they migrate to a place like 
[CPAN], [RubyGems], [PyPI], [npm], etc.

I've enjoyed using several computer programming languages over the years. I
guess it started with BASIC, Fortran and Pascal in the 1980s. I was very lucky
to have an excellent computer science teacher in HighSchool. We had a lot of
fun. 

I started university as an Engineering major, but quickly started changing 
majors each semester from Philosophy, to Computer Science and finally landed 
on English Literature. On graduation I didn't end up doing much programming 
but returned to it 5 years later when I started a degree in Library Science. 
That's when the web was just growing, and I learned HTML and Perl.

Here are a few things I'm particularly fond of that I've worked on in the past:

* [anon] - a bot to tweet when someone edits wikipedia from a particular IP 
  address range, like [Congress]
* [wikistream] - a visualization of realtime edits to Wikipedia
* [pymarc] - process MARC data in Python
* [bagit] - a tool to package data using BagIt
* [chronam] - software that runs [Chronicling America] at the Library of 
  Congress
* [id] - the prototype that ran at [id.loc.gov] to make the Library of Congress
  Subject Headings available as Linked Data.
