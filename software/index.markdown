I like to write software for libraries and archives. I try to live up to at 
least the former in [Release Early, Release Often][Raymond], so most of my 
code musings can be found on [GitHub]. The idea is things incubate there, 
and if they ever become anything more than a plaything they migrate to a 
place like [CPAN], [RubyGems], [PyPI], [npm], etc. I like to work in public
because it's been extremely useful to get advice from people over the years.

I've enjoyed using several computer programming languages over the years. I
guess it started with BASIC, Fortran and Pascal in the 1980s. I was very lucky
to have an excellent computer science teacher in High School. We had a lot of
fun. Thanks Mr Cave!

I started university as an Engineering major, but after the first year I 
switched to Philosophy, then to Computer Science and finally landed 
on English Literature. On graduation I didn't end up doing much work with
computers but did spend five users working/traveling in the UK and working
in a used bookstore. That's when the web was just starting to really take
shape, so I went back to university to get a Library and Information Science
degree. The best bits of that were learning about hypermedia.

If you really want to know more you can read about the rest in [my CV](/ehs/).

Here are a few things I'm particularly fond of that I've worked on in the past:

* [anon] - a bot to tweet when someone edits wikipedia from a particular IP 
  address range, like [Congress]
* [wikistream] - a visualization of realtime edits to Wikipedia
* [pymarc] - process MARC data in Python
* [bagit] - a tool to package data using BagIt
* [chronam] - software that runs [Chronicling America] at the Library of 
  Congress
* [id] - the prototype that ran at [id.loc.gov] to make the Library of Congress
  Subject Headings available as Linked Data.

You can find the reset on [GitHub](http://github.com/edsu).
