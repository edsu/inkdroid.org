  {"id":":2021","abstract":"Through twelve ethnographic case studies, The Social Life of Standards reveals how standards - political and technical tools for organizing society - are developed, applied, subverted, contested, and reassembled by local communities interacting with norms often created by others. Contributors explore standards at work across different countries and contexts, such as Ebola biomedical safety precautions in Senegal, Colombian farmers contesting politicized seed regulations, and the application of Indigenous standards to Canadian environmental assessments. They emphasize the uncomfortable fit between the often messy and inconsistent implementation of standards in the real world and the monolithic, non-negotiable criteria presupposed by external forces. Overt conflict arises when standards misrepresent important local (or global) realities. How do communities actively challenge and re-create standards that do not meet their needs? The Social Life of Standards provides an important anthropological perspective on the articulation of standards. The goal is to arrive at a more reflexive process that offers progressive engagement at the local level. Ultimately, we need an effective balance between evidence-based science, the social contexts that inform more useful and appropriate standards, and the inherent potential for activism.","call-number":"305.800 72","citation-key":":2021","event-place":"Vancouver [British Columbia] Toronto [Ontario]","ISBN":"978-0-7748-6523-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"UBC Press","publisher-place":"Vancouver [British Columbia] Toronto [Ontario]","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The social life of standards: ethnographic methods for local engagement","title-short":"The social life of standards","type":"book"},

  {"id":"abbingThisSolarpoweredWebsite2021","abstract":"This paper describes how principles derived from degrowth can be a useful heuristic for designing an ICT system within energy limits. It does so by discussing the design choices behind https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com, an ongoing design research project that set out to build a ’low-tech website’. This research re-sulted in a design which is lightweight, tailored towards older and lower-powered devices, is powered by off-grid solar energy and thus designed with energy scarcity in mind. The project shows that values and frameworks theorized within the Computing within Limits community are technically applicable to practices of web development but also identifies hurdles to their more widespread applicability.","author":[{"family":"Abbing","given":"Roel Roscam"}],"citation-key":"abbingThisSolarpoweredWebsite2021","container-title":"LIMITS '21","event-title":"Workshop on Computation Within Limits","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,14],["2021",6,15]]},"title":"‘This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goesoffline’: a design inquiry into degrowth and ICT","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://computingwithinlimits.org/2021/papers/limits21-abbing.pdf"},

  {"id":"allenResearchNoteExamining","abstract":"We examine potential bias in Facebook’s 10-trillion  cell  URLs  dataset,  consisting  of  URLs  shared  on  its \nplatform and their engagement metrics. Despite the unprecedented size of the dataset, it was altered to \nprotect user privacy in two ways: 1) by adding differentially private noise to engagement counts, and 2) \nby  censoring  the  data  with a  100-public-share threshold for a URL’s inclusion. To understand how these \nalterations  affect  conclusions  drawn  from  the  data,  we  estimate  the  prevalence  of  fake  news  in  the \nmassive, censored URLs dataset and compare it to an estimate from a smaller, representative dataset. We \nshow  that  censoring  can  substantially  alter  conclusions  that  are  drawn  from  the  Facebook  dataset. \nBecause of this 100-public-share threshold, descriptive statistics from the Facebook URLs  dataset \noverestimate the share of fake news and news overall by as much as 4X. We conclude with more general \nimplications for censoring data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Mobius","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Rothschild","given":"David M."},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"allenResearchNoteExamining","container-title":"Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review","DOI":"10.37016/mr-2020-74","issue":"4","title":"Research note: Examining potential bias in large-scale  censored data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-examining-potential-bias-in-large-scale-censored-data/","volume":"2"},

It aims to demonstrate how an analysis of memory, undertaken from the perspective of governmentality, can provide an important diagnostic of our time(s) and its political conditions, while furthermore illuminating how these are derived from narratives about the past. For this, I put into dialogue theoretical considerations of the Foucauldian concept with findings from a study of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. With a special focus on public memories that are performed and produced at the juncture of Holocaust memory and advocacy for human rights, this article puts forward an innovative approach to public memory’s entanglements with contemporary politics and subsequently argues that any public memory can in the broader context of governmental rationalities be understood as a technique of government itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Antweiler","given":"Katrin"}],"citation-key":"antweilerMemoryMeansGovernmentality2023","container-title":"Memory Studies","container-title-short":"Memory Studies","DOI":"10.1177/17506980221150892","ISSN":"1750-6980, 1750-6999","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,14]]},"language":"en","page":"175069802211508","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Memory as a means of governmentality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17506980221150892"},

Users are presented with a Wikipedia-like interface, containing a short fantasy description of the topic and containing embedded web-links to other related subjects. Users may click on links to learn more about different topics, following an endless trail of generated pages. The GPT2 architecture is a text completion model – it has no explicit understanding of structure and it can be a challenge to integrate it with authorial intent. Nevertheless, through this work we show that it can be conditioned to learn to write about a subject and additionally to generate the topology for an encyclopedia. We refer to this technique as subject conditioning, or more generally, structural conditioning.","author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"austinBookEndlessHistory2019","container-title":"Interactive Storytelling","event-place":"Cottonwood Canyon, Utah","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Cottonwood Canyon, Utah","title":"The Book of Endless History: Authorial Use of GPT-2 for Interactive Storytelling","type":"chapter"},

Digital media introduce new temporal patterns in their features of instant communication, synchronous collaboration, intricate time management, and continually improved speed. They construct temporal infrastructures that affect the rhythms of lived experience and shape social relations and practices of cooperation.

In this book the authors critically analyse the ways in which these new technologies have reshaped our world in numerous respects, ranging from politics, ideology, and philosophy over art and communication to memory and identity. The book challenges the customary view of a divide between analog and digital culture, claiming instead that human endeavour has always been characterized by certain forms and aspects of digital thinking, building, and communicating, and that essential parts of analog culture are still being reshaped by new digital technologies. It offers a multidisciplinary approach to digital reason, reflecting the diversity of humanities scholarship and its fundamental contribution to the ongoing changes in our current and future thinking and doing","author":[{"family":"Baetens","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Graef","given":"Ortwin","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mandolessi","given":"Silvana"}],"call-number":"HM851 .B3435 2020","citation-key":"Baetens:2020","event-place":"Leuven, Belgium","ISBN":"978-94-6270-206-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"note":"OCLC: on1111642237","number-of-pages":"272","publisher":"Leuven University Press","publisher-place":"Leuven, Belgium","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Digital reason: a guide to meaning, medium and community in a modern world","title-short":"Digital reason","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bajerUnderstandingSourceCode2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The article discusses the attempt to understand a source code under the conception of philosophical hermeneutics guided by language. Based on a confrontation between H.-G. Gadamer’s and Paul Ricoeur’s philosophy, our main goal would be searching for the essence of the source code in language. Thus, a closer look is taken into cultural symbols, natural language, and artificial languages. Especially, there would be discussed the problem of abstraction, linguistic community, self-forgetfulness, vitality of formal languages, and display of individuality. This is where the cultural layer of the code can be traced, hence we may find our world-view verbal in nature. In line with the Critical Code Studies approach, in this article, the source code is treated as text. Because of its complexity, the issue should be studied within philosophical inquiry and computer science knowledge. Hence, the perspective developed here goes back to origins and provides a philosophical foundation for Critical Code Studies thinking. The article presents academics with a philosophical challenge: how to understand the source code with an adaptation of a philosophy rejecting artificiality. With philosophical reflection, the source code gains additional meaning and experiences increase in being. Understanding happens in language, which realizes as discourse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bajer","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"bajerUnderstandingSourceCode2021","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqab089","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,27]]},"language":"en","page":"fqab089","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding of source code in language: Contribution of philosophical hermeneutics to the critical code studies","title-short":"Understanding of source code in language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqab089/6375769"},

  {"id":"bastosThisAccountDoesn2021","abstract":"Literature on influence operations has identified metrics that are indicative of social media manipulation, but few studies have explored the lifecycle of low-quality information. We contribute to this literature by reconstructing nearly 3 million messages posted by 1 million users in the last days of the Brexit referendum campaign. While previous studies have found that on average only 4% of tweets disappear, we found that 33% of the tweets leading up to the referendum vote are no longer available. Only about half of the most active accounts that tweeted the referendum continue to operate publicly, and 20% of all accounts are no longer active. We tested whether partisan content was more likely to disappear and found more messages from the Leave campaign that disappeared than the entire universe of tweets affiliated with the Remain campaign. We compare these results with an assorted set of 45 hashtags posted in the same period and find that political campaigns present much higher ratios of user and tweet decay.

However, even though it has becomeubiquitous,  just  collecting  large-scale  social  media  data  in-volves a high degree of engineering skill set and computa-tional resources. In fact, research is often times gated by dataengineering problems that must be overcome before analy-sis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets asmeaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called “front page of the Internet,” in particularhas been the subject of numerous scientific studies. AlthoughReddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to so-cial media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technicalbarriers  to  acquisition  still  remain.  Thus,  Reddit’s  millionsof subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and billions ofcomments are at the same time relatively accessible, but timeconsuming to collect and analyze systematically.In  this  paper,  we  present  the  Pushshift  Reddit  dataset.Pushshift  is  a  social  media  data  collection,  analysis,  andarchiving  platform  that  since  2015  has  collected  Redditdata and made it available to researchers. Pushshift’s Redditdataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical databack  to  Reddit’s  inception.  In  addition  to  monthly  dumps,Pushshift  provides  computational  tools  to  aid  in  searching,aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the en-tirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes itpossible  for  social  media  researchers  to  reduce  time  spentin the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.","author":[{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Zannettou","given":"Savvas"},{"family":"Keegan","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Squire","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Blackburn","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"Baumgartner:2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the Fourteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media","event-place":"Atlanta, Georgia","event-title":"ProceedingsAAAI Conference on Web and Social Media","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher-place":"Atlanta, Georgia","title":"The PushShift Reddit Dataset","type":"paper-conference"},

In this paper we argue that sustainability needs to be understood in relation to social space. We do so by engaging with Pierre Bourdieu’s thinking tools as well as Edward Soja’s spatial analysis to deconstruct how differently positioned actors understand and relate to space, including how to sustain it. Drawing on focus group and interview data from a small Australian city, we use Soja’s typology to critique spatial tropes and dualistic frames common in sustainability discourses such as ecological/social, global/local, and reveal nuanced interpretations of spatial relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Beasy","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Corbett","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"beasyWhatCountsSustainability2021","container-title":"Environmental Sociology","DOI":"10.1080/23251042.2021.1913320","ISSN":"null","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,14]]},"page":"1-11","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What counts as sustainability?: a sociospatial analysis","title-short":"What counts as sustainability?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2021.1913320","volume":"0"},

Following recent debates on data colonialism, it argues that Facebook dialectically assumes a role of a new archon of public records, while being unarchivable by design. It then puts forward counter-archiving – a practice developed to resist the epistemic hegemony of colonial archives – as a method that allows the critical study of the social media platform, after it had shut down researcher’s access to public data through its application programming interface. After defining and justifying counter-archiving as a method for studying datafied platforms, two counter-archives are presented as proof of concept.

  {"id":"benqueCaseBoardTraces2020","abstract":"This PhD thesis utilises diagrams as a language for research and design practice to critically investigate algorithmic prediction. As a tool for practice-based research, the language of diagrams is presented as a way to\nread algorithmic prediction as a set of intricate computational geometries, and to write it through critical practice immersed in the very materials in question: data and code. From a position rooted in graphic and interaction design, the research uses diagrams to gain purchase on algorithmic prediction, making it available for examination, experimentation, and critique. The project is framed by media archaeology, used here as a methodology through which both the technical and historical \"depths\" of algorithmic systems are excavated.\n\nMy main research question asks:\n\nHow can diagrams be used as a language to critically investigate algorithmic prediction through design practice?\n\nThis thesis presents two secondary questions for critical examination, asking:\n\nThrough which mechanisms does thinking/writing/designing in diagrammatic terms inform research and practice focused on algorithmic prediction?\n\nAs algorithmic systems claim to produce objective knowledge, how can diagrams be used as instruments for speculative and/or conjectural knowledge production?\n\nI contextualise my research by establishing three registers of relations between diagrams and algorithmic prediction. These are identified as: Data Diagrams to describe the algorithmic forms and processes through which data are turned into predictions; Control Diagrams to afford critical perspectives on algorithmic prediction, framing the latter as an apparatus of prescription and control; and Speculative Diagrams to open up opportunities for reclaiming the generative potential of computation. These categories form the scaffolding for the three practice-oriented chapters where I evidence a range of meaningful ways to investigate algorithmic prediction through diagrams.\n\nThis includes, the 'case board' where I unpack some of the historical genealogies of algorithmic prediction. A purpose-built graph application materialises broader reflections about how such genealogies might be conceptualised, and facilitates a visual and subjective mode of knowledge production. I then move to producing 'traces', namely probing the output of an algorithmic prediction system|in this case YouTube recommendations. Traces, and the purpose-built instruments used to visualise them, interrogate both the mechanisms of algorithmic capture and claims to make these mechanisms transparent through data visualisations. Finally, I produce algorithmic predictions and examine the diagrammatic \"tricks,\" or 'chicanes', that this involves. I revisit a historical prototype for algorithmic prediction, the almanac publication, and use it to question the boundaries between data-science and divination. This is materialised through a new version of the almanac - an automated publication where algorithmic processes are used to produce divinatory predictions.\n\nMy original contribution to knowledge is an approach to practice-based research which draws from media archaeology and focuses on diagrams to investigate algorithmic prediction through design practice. I demonstrate to researchers and practitioners with interests in algorithmic systems, prediction, and/or speculation, that diagrams can be used as a language to engage critically with these themes.","author":[{"family":"Benque","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"benqueCaseBoardTraces2020","event-place":"London","genre":"PhD Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Royal College of Art","publisher-place":"London","title":"Case board, traces, & chicanes: Diagrams for an archaeology of algorithmic prediction through critical design practice","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"bhargavanFormalVerificationSmart2016","abstract":"Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker.\n\nIn this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhargavan","given":"Karthikeyan"},{"family":"Delignat-Lavaud","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Fournet","given":"Cédric"},{"family":"Gollamudi","given":"Anitha"},{"family":"Gonthier","given":"Georges"},{"family":"Kobeissi","given":"Nadim"},{"family":"Kulatova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Rastogi","given":"Aseem"},{"family":"Sibut-Pinote","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Swamy","given":"Nikhil"},{"family":"Zanella-Béguelin","given":"Santiago"}],"citation-key":"bhargavanFormalVerificationSmart2016","container-title":"ACM Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security","DOI":"10.1145/2993600.2993611","event-place":"Vienna, Austria","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"publisher-place":"Vienna, Austria","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Formal Verification of Smart Contracts: Short Paper","title-short":"Formal Verification of Smart Contracts","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01400469"},

  {"id":"Birhane:2021","abstract":"We have now entered the era of trillion parameter machine learning models trained on billion-sized datasets scraped from the internet. The rise of these gargantuan datasets has given rise to formidable bodies of critical work that has called for caution while generating these large datasets. These address concerns surrounding the dubious curation practices used to generate these datasets, the sordid quality of alt-text data available on the world wide web, the problematic content of the CommonCrawl dataset often used as a source for training large language models, and the entrenched biases in large-scale visio-linguistic models (such as OpenAI's CLIP model) trained on opaque datasets (WebImageText). In the backdrop of these specific calls of caution, we examine the recently released LAION-400M dataset, which is a CLIP-filtered dataset of Image-Alt-text pairs parsed from the Common-Crawl dataset. We found that the dataset contains, troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content. We outline numerous implications, concerns and downstream harms regarding the current state of large scale datasets while raising open questions for various stakeholders including the AI community, regulators, policy makers and data subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Birhane","given":"Abeba"},{"family":"Prabhu","given":"Vinay Uday"},{"family":"Kahembwe","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"Birhane:2021","container-title":"arXiv:2110.01963 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Multimodal datasets: misogyny, pornography, and malignant stereotypes","title-short":"Multimodal datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01963"},

This article advocates the research subfield of social media memory studies based on empirical data from a case study on the role of social media in a local conflict about re-naming a public square in an average German town. The square had been named after Paul von Hindenburg, who played a crucial role in the implementation of Adolf Hitler as German Reichskanzler and was therefore regarded as an inadequate public patron. Conservatives fought against the new name, also on Facebook. Our findings indicate that the platform played a decisive role as counter-public sphere against hegemonic mainstream media and politics in fostering a new historical consciousness.

This rich, unique resource traces the history of information with an approach designed to draw connections across fields and perspectives, and provide essential context for our current age of information. Clear, accessible, and authoritative, the book opens with a series of articles that provide a narrative history of information from premodern practices to twenty-first-century information culture. This section focuses on major developments in the creation, storage, search, exchange, management, and manipulation of information, as well as the many meanings and uses of information over time. Coverage spans Europe, North America, and many other places and periods, including the medieval Islamic world and early modern East Asia, as well as the emergence of global networks. A second, alphabetical section includes more than 100 concise articles that cover specific concepts (e.g., data, intellectual property, privacy); formats and genres (books, databases, maps, newspapers, scrolls, social media); people (archivists, diplomats and spies, readers, secretaries, teachers); practices (censorship, forecasting, learning, surveilling, translating); processes (digitization, quantification, storage and search); systems (bureaucracy, platforms, telecommunications); technologies (algorithms, cameras, computers), and much more.

  {"id":"brandHowBuildingsLearn1995","abstract":"\"Buildings have often been studied whole in space, but never before have they been studied whole in time.\" \"Architects (and architectural historians) are interested only in a building's original intentions. Most are dismayed by what happens later, when a building develops its own life, responsive to the life within. To get the rest of the story - to explore the years between the dazzle of a new building and its eventual corpse - Stewart Brand went to facilities managers and real estate professionals, to preservationists and building historians, to photo archives and to futurists. He inquired, \"What makes some buildings come to be loved?\" He found that all buildings are forced to adapt, but only some adapt gracefully.\" \"How Buildings Learn is a masterful new synthesis which proposes that buildings adapt best when constantly refined and reshaped by their occupants, and that architects can mature from being artists of space to becoming artists of time. A rich resource and point of departure, as stimulating for the general reader and home improvement hobbyist as for the building professional, the book is sure to generate ideas, provoke debate, and shake up habitual thinking.\" \"From the connected farmhouses of New England to I.M. Pei's Media Lab, from \"satisficing\" to \"form follows funding,\" from the evolution of bungalows to the invention of Santa Fe Style, from Low Road military surplus buildings to a High Road English classic like Chatsworth - this is a far-ranging survey of unexplored essential territory.\" \"More than any other human artifact, buildings improve with time - if they're allowed.

  {"id":"brucePracticalStatisticsData2020","abstract":"Statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet few data scientists have formal statistical training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. The second edition of this practical guide-now including examples in Python as well as R-explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not. Many data scientists use statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R or Python programming languages, and have had some exposure to statistics but want to learn more, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format. With this updated edition, you'll dive into: Exploratory data analysis Data and sampling distributions Statistical experiments and significance testing Regression and prediction Classification Statistical machine learning Unsupervised learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruce","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bruce","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Gedeck","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Safari","given":"an O'Reilly Media Company"}],"citation-key":"brucePracticalStatisticsData2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1138943866","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition","type":"book","URL":"https://safarijv.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=UtNi1m1IRXgzYFIwZrhSxell9EDRaL2v&response_type=code&connection=queensland-university-of-technology&redirect_uri=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/complete/auth0-oauth2/&state=/library/view/-/ 9781492072935/?ar"},

  {"id":"Caswell:2021","abstract":"With the success of large-scale pre-training and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of languages. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly available datasets, or whether the datasets actually contain content in the languages they claim to represent. In this work, we manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness of language codes in a sixth (JW300). We find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least 15 corpora are completely erroneous, and a significant fraction contains less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality. Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-speakers of the languages in question, and supplement the human judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired by our analysis, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss the risks that come with low-quality data releases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Kreutzer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wahab","given":"Ahsan"},{"family":"Esch","given":"Daan","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Ulzii-Orshikh","given":"Nasanbayar"},{"family":"Tapo","given":"Allahsera"},{"family":"Subramani","given":"Nishant"},{"family":"Sokolov","given":"Artem"},{"family":"Sikasote","given":"Claytone"},{"family":"Setyawan","given":"Monang"},{"family":"Sarin","given":"Supheakmungkol"},{"family":"Samb","given":"Sokhar"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Papadimitriou","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Osei","given":"Salomey"},{"family":"Suárez","given":"Pedro Javier Ortiz"},{"family":"Orife","given":"Iroro"},{"family":"Ogueji","given":"Kelechi"},{"family":"Niyongabo","given":"Rubungo Andre"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Toan Q."},{"family":"Müller","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Müller","given":"André"},{"family":"Muhammad","given":"Shamsuddeen Hassan"},{"family":"Muhammad","given":"Nanda"},{"family":"Mnyakeni","given":"Ayanda"},{"family":"Mirzakhalov","given":"Jamshidbek"},{"family":"Matangira","given":"Tapiwanashe"},{"family":"Leong","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Nze"},{"family":"Kudugunta","given":"Sneha"},{"family":"Jernite","given":"Yacine"},{"family":"Jenny","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Firat","given":"Orhan"},{"family":"Dossou","given":"Bonaventure F.

  {"id":"caswellUrgentArchivesEnacting2021","abstract":"\"Urgent Archives argues that archivists can and should do more to disrupt white supremacy and hetero-patriarchy beyond the standard liberal archival solutions of more diverse collecting and more inclusive description. Grounded in the emerging field of critical archival studies, this book uncovers how dominant western archival theories and practices are oppressive by design, while looking toward the the radical politics of community archives to envision new liberatory theories and practices. Based on more than a decade of ethnography at community archives sites including the South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA), the book explores how members of minoritized communities activate records to build solidarities across and within communities, trouble linear progress narratives, and disrupt cycles of oppression. Caswell explores the temporal, representational, and material aspects of liberatory memory work, arguing that archival disruptions in time and space should be neither about the past nor the future, but about the liberatory affects and effects of memory work in the present. Urgent Archives extends the theoretical range of critical archival studies and provides a new framework for archivists looking to transform their practices. The book should also be of interest to scholars of archival studies, museum studies, public history, memory studies, gender and ethnic studies and digital humanities\"--","author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Michelle"}],"call-number":"CD3021 .C37 2021","citation-key":"caswellUrgentArchivesEnacting2021","collection-title":"Routledge studies in archives","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-367-42727-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Urgent archives: enacting liberatory memory work","title-short":"Urgent archives","type":"book"},

The ability of these models to memorize an unknown set of books complicates assessments of measurement validity for cultural analytics by contaminating test data; we show that models perform much better on memorized books than on non-memorized books for downstream tasks. We argue that this supports a case for open models whose training data is known.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Kent K."},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Mackenzie"},{"family":"Soni","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Bamman","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"changSpeakMemoryArchaeology2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.00118","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Speak, Memory: An Archaeology of Books Known to ChatGPT/GPT-4","title-short":"Speak, Memory","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00118"},

And what does that imply for development organizations? In this eye-opening book, sustainable software advocates Anne Currie, Sarah Hsu, and Sara Bergman provide a unique overview of this topic—discussing everything from the likely evolution of national grids to the effect those changes will have on the day-to-day lives of developers. Ideal for everyone from new developers to CTOs, Building Green Software tackles the challenges involved and shows you how to build, host, and operate code in a way that's not only better for the planet, but also cheaper and relatively low-risk for your business. Most hyperscale public cloud providers have already committed to net-zero IT operations by 2030.

  {"id":"Dearborn:2017","abstract":"Disaster, loss, and failure preoccupy the minds of many digital preservation professionals, and yet, despite the prominence of digital disaster planning guidelines which seem to anticipate failure, there is limited discussion of experience with preservation system or network failures, which are often framed as inevitable in digital preservation. Despite this framing, negative perceptions of failure influence the digital preservation discourse by associating failure with poor planning, unreliability, and untrustworthiness on the part of institutions. This article will interrogate the issue of failure within the digital preservation field and consider the need for more conversations around network failure and recovery. The authors will argue that failure is part of the process of digital preservation and more honest conversations around this topic will contribute to the practice of openness and transparency within the digital preservation community. To illustrate these issues, the authors will discuss the actual hardware failures experienced by the MetaArchive Cooperative, a community-based distributed digital preservation network, and how the Cooperative’s utilization of the LOCKSS software allowed it to recover from those failures. Additionally, the lessons learned and resulting changes the Cooperative made to technical infrastructure, hardware diversity, policies and procedures will be shared.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Dearborn","given":"Carly"},{"family":"Meister","given":"Sam"}],"citation-key":"Dearborn:2017","container-title":"Alexandria: The Journal of National and International Library and Information Issues","container-title-short":"Alexandria","DOI":"10.1177/0955749017722076","ISSN":"0955-7490, 2050-4551","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"language":"en","page":"83-93","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Failure as process: Interrogating disaster, loss, and recovery in digital preservation","title-short":"Failure as process","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0955749017722076","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"Debaise:2024","abstract":"In his major work, An Inquiry into the Modes of Existence, Bruno Latour sets out to establish an anthropology of the Moderns based on the plurality of the modes of existence that make up their world. What about the beings of science, politics, art, religion, economics and so on? How do these beings relate to one another, and how do they constitute the specific forms of thought of the Moderns? Taking as its starting point one of the central notions of modern thought, namely the notion of matter, this article seeks to identify the way in which Latour shows its importance in the constitution of modern thought. It examines its topicality through the double prism of an ecological and decolonial approach that animates Latour’s work, and which this article proposes to revisit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Debaise","given":"Didier"}],"citation-key":"Debaise:2024","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/02632764241275489","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"02632764241275489","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Land of the Moderns: The Sense of Latour’s Pragmatism","title-short":"The Land of the Moderns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02632764241275489"},

  {"id":"Denton:2021","abstract":"In response to growing concerns of bias, discrimination, and unfairness perpetuated by algorithmic systems, the datasets used to train and evaluate machine learning models have come under increased scrutiny. Many of these examinations have focused on the contents of machine learning datasets, finding glaring underrepresentation of minoritized groups. In contrast, relatively little work has been done to examine the norms, values, and assumptions embedded in these datasets. In this work, we conceptualize machine learning datasets as a type of informational infrastructure, and motivate a genealogy as method in examining the histories and modes of constitution at play in their creation. We present a critical history of ImageNet as an exemplar, utilizing critical discourse analysis of major texts around ImageNet’s creation and impact. We find that assumptions around ImageNet and other large computer vision datasets more generally rely on three themes: the aggregation and accumulation of more data, the computational construction of meaning, and making certain types of data labor invisible. By tracing the discourses that surround this influential benchmark, we contribute to the ongoing development of the standards and norms around data development in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Amironesei","given":"Razvan"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Nicole","given":"Hilary"}],"citation-key":"Denton:2021","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517211035955","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172110359","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets: A critical history of ImageNet","title-short":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211035955","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Diehm:2021","abstract":"Within ethical design practices, informed user consent is a key requirement in the effort to invert the power imbalances fostered by the digital platforms that enable platform owners (organizations, governments, etc.) to build data profiles and make decisions about people. Much work has been completed by designers, activists, and aligned policymakers to translate data governance policies into plain-language and comprehensible  consent. But the question remains: How well do these efforts account for the broader socio-technical power structures inherent in all personal data collection? Through a series of interviews with advocates for individuals and communities whose lives are often dramatically affected by data surveillance, this study finds that ongoing attempts to cultivate informed consent into data-driven systems likely fall short of their stated goals. The current implementations of ethical digital consent indicate that platform designers and policymakers have an insufficient understanding of systems complexity at scale, political accountability, the power dynamics inherent to organizational politics, and the second- or third-order effects of local-first data strategies. This study documents the inherent threats and risks for consent-driven digital technologies that current approaches do not address.","author":[{"family":"Diehm","given":"Cade"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Ame"},{"family":"Bullen","given":"Georgia"}],"citation-key":"Diehm:2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"publisher":"Simply Secure & The New Design Congress","title":"The Limits to Digital Consent: Understanding the risks of ethical consent and data collection for underrepresented communities.","type":"report","URL":"https://ndc.substack.com/p/the-limits-to-digital-consent"},

  {"id":"Dodge:2021","abstract":"Large language models have led to remarkable progress on many NLP tasks, and researchers are turning to ever-larger text corpora to train them. Some of the largest corpora available are made by scraping significant portions of the internet, and are frequently introduced with only minimal documentation. In this work we provide some of the first documentation for the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4; Raffel et al., 2020), a dataset created by applying a set of filters to a single snapshot of Common Crawl. We begin by investigating where the data came from, and find a significant amount of text from unexpected sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets. To understand the impact of the filters applied to create this dataset, we evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for how to created and document web-scale datasets from a scrape of the internet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dodge","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Sap","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Marasović","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Agnew","given":"William"},{"family":"Ilharco","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Groeneveld","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Matt"}],"citation-key":"Dodge:2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,30]]},"number":"arXiv:2104.08758","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Documenting Large Webtext Corpora: A Case Study on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus","title-short":"Documenting Large Webtext Corpora","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08758"},

Archival professional organisations in both countries attempt to confront this issue by focusing on the homogeneity of the profession, specifically through using the discourse of diversity. Thus, this keynote address, delivered at the 2017 conference of the Australian Society of Archivists in Melbourne, explores the following question: how, if at all, does diversity form part of the solution for dismantling the white supremacy of archives? It begins this inquiry by recounting the author's participation and experience with diversity projects of the Society of American Archivists, before speculating how archivists might transition away from the language of diversity and towards the language of liberation through the concept of an archive of the oppressed.

  {"id":"drakeArchivingBlackMovements2022","abstract":"With the move towards both critical information literacy and community-centered archives, cultural heritage and information professionals have been called to further interrogate our role as collectors and catalogers of materials. We know that the preservation and description of objects, records, and ephemera ascribe historical meaning, are culturally bound, and impact understanding beyond our lifetime. In this heightened time of social injustice, Black librarians, archivists, and curators are collaborating with community and organizing groups to select and preserve materials related to uprisings in real-time. However, there is a disconnect from the records and items selected for the archives and materials valued by the organizers themselves. There is also a lack of published texts centering the approaches and materials of Black people organizing for their own communities as a part of the archival record with few exceptions. Knowing there is power in the archives, there must be careful consideration to the prioritization and representation of Black communities in their own words.\nIn the following conversations, we thought critically about the provenance and authority of records found on the internet and how archivists should consider materials created by organizers and those created by the community at large. We facilitated three interviews with activists and organizers whose work focuses on the liberation of Black lives globally to both frame and interrogate current archival practices. These interviews explored our archival approach, specifically centering the narratives of the people on the ground. Through these conversations, we discussed the state of organizing and creating digital content as well as how cultural heritage professionals should prioritize the histories of various movements for Black life globally. The interviewees included activists and organizers from the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party (1968-1970s), Black Nashville Assembly, and formerly of Black Lives Matter (2013-present), and End SARS (Special Anti-Robbery Squad) movement (2020-present) in Nigeria.\nIn shaping this conversation, we considered these key questions:  What objects speak to your “work”? What content do you think will help future generations understand past and present movements around Black life? How can cultural heritage professionals determine what is created by BLM, BPP, etc. versus what is contributed by the community-at-large? What does Black liberation look like to you?\nThis article outlines and reimagines archival work as community-based, highly collaborative, and iterative for professionals outside of Black social and political movements. With a focus on intentionality around the communities impacted, individuals involved, and the movements at large, we framed what archival materials are important to Black organizers of our time. With their insight, cultural heritage and archival professionals can create deliberate processes to get direct feedback from the creators themselves for the archives. Overall, this article aims to introduce ways of thinking to decentralize power in archival collections and provide agency to organizers through their own historical record.\nPre-print first published online 8/5/2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Tracy S."},{"family":"Conner-Gaten","given":"Aisha"},{"family":"Booth","given":"Steven D."}],"citation-key":"drakeArchivingBlackMovements2022","container-title":"Journal of Critical Library and Information Studies","container-title-short":"JournalCritLIS","DOI":"10.24242/jclis.v4i1.170","ISSN":"2572-1364","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,5]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Archiving Black Movements: Shifting Power and Exploring a Community-Centered Approach","title-short":"Archiving Black Movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.litwinbooks.com/index.php/jclis/article/view/170","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"emanuelAssemblingAccountabilityAlgorithmic2021","abstract":"This report maps the challenges of constructing algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs) by analyzing impact assessments in other domains—from the environment to human rights to privacy. Impact assessment is a promising model of algorithmic governance because it bundles an account of potential and actual harms of a system with a means for identifying who is responsible for their remedy. Success in governing with AIAs requires thoughtful engagement with the ongoing exercise of social and political power, rather than defaulting to self-assessment and narrow technical metrics. Without such engagement, AIAs run the risk of not adequately facilitating the measurement of, and contestation over, harms experienced by people, communities, and society","author":[{"family":"Emanuel","given":"Moss"},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Elizabeth Anne"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Ranjit"},{"family":"Elish","given":"Madeleine Clare"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"emanuelAssemblingAccountabilityAlgorithmic2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"publisher":"Data & Society","title":"Assembling Accountability: Algorithmic Assessment Impact for the Public Interest","type":"report","URL":"https://datasociety.net/library/assembling-accountability-algorithmic-impact-assessment-for-the-public-interest/"},

As importantly, they demonstrate how much recordkeeping matters in people’s lives and the role that records play in developing and nurturing identity, connection to family, community, and culture, and as instruments of accountability, restitution, and redress. They highlight the transdisciplinarity inherent in recordkeeping endeavours, and for research and praxis in child welfare and protection to transcend disciplinary, professional, and community boundaries to ensure that systems created to protect children from neglect and abuse do not themselves cause harm. In this article we explore the transformative justice approach of the Archives and the Rights of the Child Research Programme, that, through transdisciplinary collaborations investigating rights-based recordkeeping, aims to advance archival autonomy, the ability of individuals and communities to participate in organizational and societal evidence and memory structures with their own voice. This broad re-imagining of recordkeeping is vital if we are to escape endless cycles of ambiguous and disappointing transitional justice outcomes, through recognizing voice and agency in recordkeeping as a human right.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Jacqueline Z."},{"family":"McKemmish","given":"Sue"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Antonina"},{"family":"McGinniss","given":"David"},{"family":"Rolan","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Altham","given":"Siobhan"}],"citation-key":"Evans:2021","container-title":"Archives and Records","DOI":"10.1080/23257962.2020.1865887","ISSN":"2325-7962","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,2]]},"page":"3-24","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Transformative justice: transdisciplinary collaborations for archival autonomy","title-short":"Transformative justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23257962.2020.1865887","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"eveDigitalScholarlyJournals2024","abstract":"Introduction: Digital preservation underpins the persistence of scholarly links and citations through the digital object identifier (DOI) system. We do not currently know, at scale, the extent to which articles assigned a DOI are adequately preserved.&nbsp;Methods: We construct a database of preservation information from original archival sources and then examine the preservation statuses of 7,438,037 DOIs in a random sample.&nbsp;Results: Of the 7,438,037 works examined, there were 5.9 million copies spread over the archives used in this work. Furthermore, a total of 4,342,368 of the works that we studied (58.38%) were present in at least one archive. However, this left 2,056,492 works in our sample (27.64%) that are seemingly unpreserved. The remaining 13.98% of works in the sample were excluded either for being too recent (published in the current year), not being journal articles, or having insufficient date metadata for us to identify the source.&nbsp;Discussion: Our study is limited by design in several ways. Among these are the facts that it uses only a subset of archives, it only tracks articles with DOIs, and it does not account for institutional repository coverage. Nonetheless, as an initial attempt to gauge the landscape, our results will still be of interest to libraries, publishers, and researchers.&nbsp;Conclusion: This work reveals an alarming preservation deficit. Only 0.96% of Crossref members (n = 204) can be confirmed to digitally preserve over 75% of their content in three or more of the archives that we studied. (Note that when, in this article, we write “preserved,” we mean “that we were able to confirm as preserved,” as per the specified limitations of this study.) A slightly larger proportion, i.e., 8.5% (n = 1,797), preserved over 50% of their content in two or more archives. However, many members, i.e., 57.7% (n = 12,257), only met the threshold of having 25% of their material in a single archive. Most worryingly, 32.9% (n = 6,982) of Crossref members seem not to have any adequate digital preservation in place, which is against the recommendations of the Digital Preservation Coalition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Eve","given":"Martin Paul"}],"citation-key":"eveDigitalScholarlyJournals2024","container-title":"Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication","DOI":"10.31274/jlsc.16288","ISSN":"2162-3309","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,24]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital Scholarly Journals Are Poorly Preserved: A Study of 7 Million Articles","title-short":"Digital Scholarly Journals Are Poorly Preserved","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/jlsc/article/id/16288/","volume":"12"},

Yet, while computer code can enforce rules more efficiently than legal code, it also comes with a series of limitations, mostly because it is difficult to transpose the ambiguity and flexibility of legal rules into a formalized language which can be interpreted by a machine. With the advent of blockchain technology and associated smart contracts, code is assuming an even stronger role in regulating people’s interactions over the Internet, as many contractual transactions get transposed into smart contract code.

The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking.

  {"id":"fitzpatrickPlannedObsolescencePublishing2011","abstract":"\"Academic institutions are facing a crisis in scholarly publishing at multiple levels: presses are stressed as never before, library budgets are squeezed, faculty are having difficulty publishing their work, and promotion and tenure committees are facing a range of new ways of working without a clear sense of how to understand and evaluate them. Planned Obsolescence is both a provocation to think more broadly about the academy's future and an argument for reconceiving that future in more communally-oriented ways. Facing these issues head-on, Kathleen Fitzpatrick focuses on the technological changes--especially greater utilization of internet publication technologies, including digital archives, social networking tools, and multimedia--necessary to allow academic publishing to thrive into the future. But she goes further, insisting that the key issues that must be addressed are social and institutional in origin. Springing from original research as well as Fitzpatrick's own hands-on experiments in new modes of scholarly communication through MediaCommons, the digital scholarly network she co-founded, Planned Obsolescence explores these aspects of scholarly work, as well as issues surrounding the preservation of digital scholarship and the place of publishing within the structure of the contemporary university. Written in an approachable style designed to bring administrators and scholars into a conversation, Planned Obsolescence explores both symptom and cure to ensure that scholarly communication will remain relevant in the digital future. \"--","author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"fitzpatrickPlannedObsolescencePublishing2011","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-8147-2896-3 978-0-8147-2788-1 978-0-8147-2787-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"245","publisher":"New York University Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Planned obsolescence: publishing, technology, and the future of the academy","title-short":"Planned obsolescence","type":"book"},

We expand the analysis to present three tests based on mathematical, semantic (that is, the Turing Test), and ethical questions and show that GPT-3 is not designed to pass any of them. This is a reminder that GPT-3 does not do what it is not supposed to do, and that any interpretation of GPT-3 as the beginning of the emergence of a general form of artificial intelligence is merely uninformed science fiction.

Employing Dean's “analytics of government” framework, we analyze two cases—malaria tracking in Kenya and monitoring of food prices in Indonesia. Our analysis shows that big data introduces a bias toward particular types of visualizations. What problems are being made visible through big data depends to some degree on how the underlying data is visualized and who is captured in the visualizations. It is also influenced by technical factors such as distance between mobile phone towers and the truth claims that gain legitimacy.

  {"id":"fonsecaWhetherWhenQuestion","abstract":"Data Science can be considered a technique or a science. As a technique, it is more interested in the “what” than in the “why” of data. It does not need theories that explain how things work, it just needs the results. As a science, however, working strictly from data and without theories contradicts the post-empiricist view of science. In this view, theories come before data and data is used to corroborate or falsify theories. Nevertheless, one of the most controversial statements about Data Science is that it is a science that can work without theories. In this conceptual paper, we focus on the science aspect of Data Science. How is Data Science as a science? We propose a three-phased view of Data Science that shows that different theories have different roles in each of the phases we consider. We focus on when theories are used in Data Science rather than the controversy of whether theories are used in Data Science or not. In the end, we will see that the statement “Data Science works without theories” is better put as “in some of its phases, Data Science works without the theories that originally motivated the creation of the data.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"fonsecaWhetherWhenQuestion","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24537","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Whether or when: The question on the use of theories in data science","title-short":"Whether or when","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24537","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"footWebCampaigning2006","abstract":"The use of the Web in U.S. political campaigns has developed dramatically over the course of the last several election seasons. In Web Campaigning, Kirsten Foot and Steven Schneider examine the evolution of campaigns' Web practices, based on hundreds of campaign Web sites produced by a range of political actors during the U.S. elections of 2000, 2002, and 2004. Their developmental analyses of how and why campaign organizations create specific online structures illuminates the reciprocal relationship between these production practices and the structures of both the campaign organization and the electoral arena. This practice-based approach and the focus on campaigns as Web producers make the book a significant methodological and theoretical contribution to both science and technology studies and political communication scholarship.Foot and Schneider explore the inherent tension between the desire of campaigns to maintain control over messages and resources and the generally decentralizing dynamic of Web-based communication. They analyze specific strategies by which campaigns mitigate this, examining the ways that the production techniques, coproducing Web content, online-offline convergence, and linking to other Web sites mediate the practices of informing, involving, connecting, and mobilizing supporters. Their conclusions about the past decade's trajectory of Web campaigning point the way to a political theory of technology and a technologically grounded theory of electoral politics.A digital installation available on the web illustrates core concepts discussed in the text of the book with examples drawn from archived campaign Web sites. Users have the opportunity to search these concepts in the context of fully operational campaign sites, recreating the Web experience of users during the election periods covered in the book.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Foot","given":"Kirsten A."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Steven M"}],"citation-key":"footWebCampaigning2006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Web Campaigning","type":"book","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/web-campaigning"},

  {"id":"Frew:2023","abstract":"Webpages change over time, and web archives hold copies of historical versions of webpages. Users of web archives, such as journalists, want to find and view changes on webpages over time. However, the current search interfaces for web archives do not support this task. For the web archives that include a full-text search feature, multiple versions of the same webpage that match the search query are shown individually without enumerating changes, or are grouped together in a way that hides changes. We present a change text search engine that allows users to find changes in webpages. We describe the implementation of the search engine backend and frontend, including a tool that allows users to view the changes between two webpage versions in context as an animation. We evaluate the search engine with U.S. federal environmental webpages that changed between 2016 and 2020. The change text search results page can clearly show when terms and phrases were added or removed from webpages. The inverted index can also be queried to identify salient and frequently deleted terms in a corpus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Frew","given":"Lesley"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Weigle","given":"Michele C."}],"citation-key":"Frew:2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,30]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.00546","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Making Changes in Webpages Discoverable: A Change-Text Search Interface for Web Archives","title-short":"Making Changes in Webpages Discoverable","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00546"},

  {"id":"geigerGarbageGarbageOut2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Supervised machine learning, in which models are automatically derived from labeled training data, is only as good as the quality of that data. This study builds on prior work that investigated to what extent “best practices” around labeling training data were followed in applied ML publications within a single domain (social media platforms). In this paper, we expand by studying publications that apply supervised ML in a far broader spectrum of disciplines, focusing on human-labeled data. We report to what extent a random sample of ML application papers across disciplines give specific details about whether best practices were followed, while acknowledging that a greater range of application fields necessarily produces greater diversity of labeling and annotation methods. Because much of machine learning research and education only focuses on what is done once a “ground truth” or “gold standard” of training data is available, it is especially relevant to discuss issues around the equally important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first place. This determination becomes increasingly complex when applied to a variety of specialized fields, as labeling can range from a task requiring little-to-no background knowledge to one that must be performed by someone with career expertise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Geiger","given":"R.

  {"id":"Giannone:2019","abstract":"The aim of this article is to analyse how the European Union (EU) evaluates its digital policies in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe. In fact, the evaluation process, the indicators that the EU produces and uses to this aim, how it measures states' performance in this field are all relevant issues mirroring the idea of (digital) Europe that the EU intends to build. Drawing on previous studies that have emphasised the political aspects of measurement and the governmentality power of indicators, the authors maintain that the way the EU measures the implementation of digital policies reflects a neoliberal vision of what a digital Europe should look like; furthermore, through rankings and ratings, the EU exerts a governmentality power on member states by conducting their behaviour at a distance. After introducing the theme, the study deepens the political dimension of evaluation and unfolds its crucial connection with neoliberalisation. Then it focuses on the European case, wi","author":[{"family":"Giannone","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Santaniello","given":"Mauro"}],"citation-key":"Giannone:2019","container-title":"Information, Communication  & Society","ISSN":"1369118X","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1889 - 1902","title":"Governance by indicators: the case of the Digital Agenda for Europe.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lls&AN=139136389&site=ehost-live","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"goldsmithDuchampMyLawyer2020","abstract":"\"In 1996, during the relatively early days of the web, Kenneth Goldsmith created UbuWeb to post hard-to-find works of concrete poetry. What started out as a site to share works from a relatively obscure literary movement grew into an essential archive of twentieth- and twenty-first-century avant-garde and experimental literature, film, and music. Visitors around the world now have access to both obscure and canonical works, from artists such as Kara Walker, Yoko Ono, Pauline Oliveros, Samuel Beckett, Marcel Duchamp, Cecil Taylor, Glenn Ligon, William Burroughs, and Jean-Luc Godard. In Duchamp Is My Lawyer, Goldsmith tells the history of UbuWeb, explaining the motivations behind its creation and how artistic works are archived, consumed, and distributed online. Based on his own experiences and interviews with a variety of experts, Goldsmith describes how the site navigates issues of copyright and the ways that UbuWeb challenges familiar configurations and histories of the avant-garde. The book also portrays the growth of other \"shadow libraries\" and includes a section on the artists whose works reflect the aims, aesthetics, and ethos of UbuWeb. Goldsmith concludes by contrasting UbuWeb's commitment to the free-culture movement and giving access to a wide range of artistic works with today's gatekeepers of algorithmic culture, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify\"--","author":[{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Kenneth"}],"call-number":"NX260","citation-key":"goldsmithDuchampMyLawyer2020","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-54691-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Duchamp is my lawyer: the polemics, pragmatics, and poetics of UbuWeb","title-short":"Duchamp is my lawyer","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Graeber:2017","abstract":"In anthropology as much as in popular imagination, kings are figures of fascination and intrigue, heroes or tyrants in ways presidents and prime ministers can never be. This collection of essays by two of the world's most distinguished anthropologists--David Graeber and Marshall Sahlins--explores what kingship actually is, historically and anthropologically. As they show, kings are symbols for more than just sovereignty: indeed, the study of kingship offers a unique window into fundamental dilemmas concerning the very nature of power, meaning, and the human condition. Reflecting on issues such as temporality, alterity, and utopia--not to mention the divine, the strange, the numinous, and the bestial--Graeber and Sahlins explore the role of kings as they have existed around the world, from the BaKongo to the Aztec to the Shilluk and beyond. Richly delivered with the wit and sharp analysis characteristic of Graeber and Sahlins, this book opens up new avenues for the anthropological study of this fascinating and ubiquitous political figure","author":[{"family":"Graeber","given":"David"},{"family":"Sahlins","given":"Marshall"}],"call-number":"GN492.7 .G73 2017","citation-key":"Graeber:2017","event-place":"Chicago, Illinois","ISBN":"978-0-9861325-0-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn940284146","number-of-pages":"536","publisher":"Hau Books","publisher-place":"Chicago, Illinois","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"On kings","type":"book"},

  {"id":"greenlandPixelPoliticsSatellite2022","abstract":"The pixel is a fundamental element of contemporary visual culture, with pictorial and perceptual properties that affect the interpretation of the digital composition as a whole. Despite its importance, however, the pixel remains a neglected object of analysis in cultural sociology and critical media studies. To advance a framework of pixel studies I present a hermeneutical approach. Empirically, I focus on the pixel’s political and socio-technical dimensions through satellite images of violence in the Syrian conflict zone (2011–2017). Through interviews and observations, I study the satellite programmers, technicians, archeologists, and anthropologists who comprised an interdisciplinary effort to interpret satellite pictures of archeological damage and other forms of cultural violence during the war. Their interpretations, some of which were the basis for consequential decisions by US policymakers, involved isolating as few as two pixels on the screen. To explain what this entailed, I draw on theories from Alberto Romele and Don Ihde to situate the pixel within a hermeneutic circle through which satellite images were ‘read’ at different levels. My findings have implications for broader sociological and media studies critiques of the epistemic status of digital media in light of their deep interrelations of politics, technology, and people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenland","given":"Fiona A"}],"citation-key":"greenlandPixelPoliticsSatellite2022","container-title":"Media, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Media, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/01634437221077169","ISSN":"0163-4437","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,6]]},"language":"en","page":"01634437221077169","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Pixel politics and satellite interpretation in the Syrian war","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437221077169"},

  {"id":"greinerTranslocalityConceptsApplications2013","abstract":"Abstract\n            The employment of translocality as a research perspective is currently gaining momentum. A growing number of scholars from different research traditions concerned with the dynamics of mobility, migration and socio‐spatial interconnectedness have developed conceptual approaches to the term. They usually build on insights from transnationalism while attempting to overcome some of the limitations of this long‐established research perspective. As such, translocality is used to describe socio‐spatial dynamics and processes of simultaneity and identity formation that transcend boundaries—including, but also extending beyond, those of nation states. In this review, we trace the emergence of the idea of translocality and summarise the characteristics that different authors associate with the term. We elucidate the underlying notions of mobility and place and sketch out fields of research where the concept has been employed. On the basis of our findings, we conclude by proposing key areas where a translocal approach has the potential to generate fruitful insights. © 2012 The Author.

The corpus is comprised of clustered sets of publishers and publisher locations from the library MARC21 records found in the POD Data Lake, an Ivy+ Library Consortium metadata sharing initiative. The POD Data Lake contains seventy million MARC21 records, forty million of which are unique. The discovery of publisher entity sets described forms the basis for the streamlined description of BIBFRAME Instance entities. This study resulted in two major outputs: 1) A prediction database and 2) sets of publisher location and name association rules. The association rules are the basis of a prototype autosuggestion feature of BIBFRAME Instance entity description properties designed specifically to support the autopopulation of publisher entities in linked data RDF editors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hahn","given":"Jim"}],"citation-key":"hahnPublisherReferencesBibliographic2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/pra2.479","ISSN":"2373-9231, 2373-9231","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"page":"461-465","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Publisher References in Bibliographic Entity Descriptions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08352","volume":"58"},

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user's mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user's relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making.","author":[{"family":"Hallinan","given":"Blake"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Jed R"},{"family":"Fiesler","given":"Casey"}],"citation-key":"Hallinan:2019","container-title":"New Media  & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819876944","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"title":"Unexpected expectations: Public reaction to the Facebook emotional contagion study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819876944"},

A successful pipeline moves data efficiently, minimizing pauses and blockages between tasks, keeping every process along the way operational. Apache Airflow provides a single customizable environment for building and managing data pipelines, eliminating the need for a hodgepodge collection of tools, snowflake code, and homegrown processes. Using real-world scenarios and examples, Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow teaches you how to simplify and automate data pipelines, reduce operational overhead, and smoothly integrate all the technologies in your stack... Data pipelines manage the flow of data from initial collection through consolidation, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and more. Apache Airflow provides a single platform you can use to design, implement, monitor, and maintain your pipelines. Its easy-to-use UI, plug-and-play options, and flexible Python scripting make Airflow perfect for any data management task. Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow teaches you how to build and maintain effective data pipelines. You'll explore the most common usage patterns, including aggregating multiple data sources, connecting to and from data lakes, and cloud deployment. Part reference and part tutorial, this practical guide covers every aspect of the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that power Airflow, and how to customize them for your pipeline's needs. Build, test, and deploy Airflow pipelines as DAGs; Automate moving and transforming data; Analyze historical datasets using backfilling; Develop custom components; Set up Airflow in production environments.

  {"id":"hasinoffScalabilitySubsidiarityAddressing2022","abstract":"Large social media platforms are generally designed for scalability—the ambition to increase in size without a fundamental change in form. This means that to address harm among users, they favor automated moderation wherever possible and typically apply a uniform set of rules. This article contrasts scalability with restorative and transformative justice approaches to harm, which are usually context-sensitive, relational, and individualized. We argue that subsidiarity—the principle that local social units should have meaningful autonomy within larger systems—might foster the balance between context and scale that is needed for improving responses to harm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasinoff","given":"Amy A."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"hasinoffScalabilitySubsidiarityAddressing2022","container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/20563051221126041","ISSN":"2056-3051, 2056-3051","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"205630512211260","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Scalability to Subsidiarity in Addressing Online Harm","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051221126041","volume":"8"},

Team processes, behavior, and agile practices used by team members play important parts in the success of projects. To reap benefits from these highly interactive and social-focused practices, team members need to feel safe to speak freely. We propose a model that conceptualizes the effects of psychological safety and (social) agile practices on team performance. The proposed model combines recent research from organizational psychology and agile information systems development to provide a better understanding of the team-level effects. Our findings from three case studies conducted in two large insurance companies and one software development company suggest that social agile practices positively influence psychological safety, transparency, communication, and ultimately productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hennel","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Rosenkranz","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"Hennel:2021","container-title":"Project Management Journal","container-title-short":"Project Management Journal","DOI":"10.1177/8756972820933057","ISSN":"8756-9728, 1938-9507","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"11-30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Investigating the “Socio” in Socio-Technical Development: The Case for Psychological Safety in Agile Information Systems Development","title-short":"Investigating the “Socio” in Socio-Technical Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756972820933057","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"horstDigitalAnthropology2012","abstract":"\"Anthropology has two main tasks: to understand what it is to be human and to examine how humanity is manifested differently in the diversity of culture. These tasks have gained new impetus from the extraordinary rise of the digital. This book brings together several key anthropologists working with digital culture to demonstrate just how productive an anthropological approach to the digital has already become. Through a range of case studies from Facebook to Second Life to Google Earth, Digital Anthropology explores how human and digital can be defined in relation to one another, from avatars and disability; cultural differences in how we use social networking sites or practise religion; the practical consequences of the digital for politics, museums, design, space and development to new online world and gaming communities. The book also explores the moral universe of the digital, from new anxieties to open-source ideals. Digital Anthropology reveals how only the intense scrutiny of ethnography can overturn assumptions about the impact of digital culture and reveal its profound consequences for everyday life. Combining the clarity of a textbook with an engaging style which conveys a passion for these new frontiers of enquiry, this book is essential reading for students and scholars of anthropology, media studies, communication studies, cultural studies and sociology.\"--Publisher's website","call-number":"P96.A56 D54 2012","citation-key":"horstDigitalAnthropology2012","edition":"English ed","editor":[{"family":"Horst","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"}],"event-place":"London ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-85785-291-5 978-0-85785-290-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn764357614","number-of-pages":"316","publisher":"Berg","publisher-place":"London ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Digital anthropology","type":"book"},
  {"id":"horvathVisionsHungarianArtificial2023","abstract":"In an international context where social effects and ethics related to artificial intelligence (AI) are receiving more attention, there is a dearth of research about how AI specialists perceive the future of work and their role in bringing about the respective future. Does the fact that ethics and social issues are receiving more publicity impact AI specialists’ views? The current study advances knowledge about this issue by describing a deep qualitative investigation of the visions of AI developers and researchers in Hungary, a country on the semi-periphery concerning the development of these technologies. In recent years, social and ethical challenges linked to AI have been covered in the Hungarian media as well, although they are less of a hot topic than in some Western countries. The twenty AI specialist interviewees’ accounts were characterised by their perception of the current period as one of hype, expectations of a slow and limited amount of technological change, techno-optimism, as well as a distancing of responsibility. Notably, the change in the media climate does not appear to have affected their thinking: social consequences and ethical issues associated with technology were neglected in their accounts. Potential drivers of their views and the potential effects of the country context are discussed, as well as the consequences of the experts’ expectations and implications for AI research and development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Horváth","given":"Ágnes"},{"family":"Vicsek","given":"Lilla"}],"citation-key":"horvathVisionsHungarianArtificial2023","container-title":"Science, Technology and Society","container-title-short":"Science, Technology and Society","DOI":"10.1177/09717218231186105","ISSN":"0971-7218, 0973-0796","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"09717218231186105","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visions of Hungarian Artificial Intelligence Specialists About the Future of Work and Their Roles","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09717218231186105"},

  {"id":"Houston:2022","abstract":"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the influential Club of\nRome report Limits to Growth, which used computer modelling to\nshow that, on a finite planet, current human resource use cannot\nultimately be sustained. In this paper we use the anniversary as an\nopportunity to reflect on the framing of limits in HCI. Following\nrecent work in design and social science, we ask whether the idea\nof limits is an effective way to imagine, prompt and manage\ncultural change in participatory, sustainable HCI. Drawing from our\nexperiences investigating participatory creative practice in the\nCreaTures project, we suggest that limits-led framings could be\nusefully held in tension with ideas of abundance. As researchers\nand practitioners of sustainable design, our job is often asking\nothers to use less – whether that involves consuming fewer\nmaterials, less energy; or indeed even ‘un-making’ particular\npractices. We argue that directive change can be reconceptualised\nas ‘eco-social’ transformation: a fusion of care-infused ecological\nand social sensibilities to create existential change that would\nimpact lifestyle and political choices (and technology use), turning\nto potentially abundant human resources of imagination,\nreflection and solidarity. We offer the example of The Hologram,\na feminist economist healthcare art project situated online, to\nillustrate this potential.","author":[{"family":"Houston","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Light","given":"Ann"},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Cassie"}],"citation-key":"Houston:2022","container-title":"LIMITS '22","event-title":"LIMITS '22: Workshop on Computing within Limits","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21],["2022",6,22]]},"title":"The Richness of Designing for Eco-Social Change","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://computingwithinlimits.org/2022/papers/limits22-final-Houston.pdf"},

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment  analysis,  and  compare  its  effectiveness  to eleventypical    state-of-practice    benchmarks    including    LIWC, ANEW,  the  General  Inquirer,  SentiWordNet,  and  machine learning  oriented  techniques  relying  on  Naive  Bayes,  Max-imum  Entropy,  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  algo-rithms.  Using  a  combination  of  qualitative  and quantitative methods, we first  construct and empirically  validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to  sentiment  in  microblog-like  contexts.  We  then  combine these  lexical  features  with  consideration  for  five  general rules that  embody  grammatical  and  syntactical  conventions for  expressing  and  emphasizing  sentiment  intensity.  Inter-estingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the  sentiment  of  tweets,  we  find  that VADER  outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification  Accuracy = 0.96 and  0.84,  respectively),  and  generalizes  more  favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.","author":[{"family":"Hutto","given":"C.

Archival testimony from the last khipu specialist in Anchucaya, supplemented by interviews with his grandson, provides the first known expert explanation for how goods, labour obligations, and social groups were indicated on Inka style Andean khipus. This evidence, combined with the analysis of Anchucaya khipus in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología y Historia Peruana, furnishes a local model for the relationship between the two most frequent colour patterns (colour banding and seriation) that occur in khipus. In this model, colour banding is associated with individual data whilst seriation is associated with aggregated data. The archival and ethnographic evidence also explains how labour and goods were categorized in uniquely Andean ways as they were represented on khipus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyland","given":"Sabine"}],"citation-key":"hylandHowKhipusIndicated2016","container-title":"Journal of Material Culture","container-title-short":"Journal of Material Culture","DOI":"10.1177/1359183516662677","ISSN":"1359-1835, 1460-3586","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"490-509","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How <i>khipus</i> indicated labour contributions in an Andean village: An explanation of colour banding, seriation and ethnocategories","title-short":"How <i>khipus</i> indicated labour contributions in an Andean village","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/9237","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"Janssen:2016","abstract":"Big data is driving the use of algorithm in governing mundane but mission-critical tasks. Algorithms seldom operate on their own and their (dis)utilities are dependent on the everyday aspects of data capture, processing and utilization. However, as algorithms become increasingly autonomous and invisible, they become harder for the public to detect and scrutinize their impartiality status . Algorithms can systematically introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination, favor a political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. Yet it is difficult to hold algorithms accountable as they continuously evolve with technologies, systems, data and people, the ebb and flow of policy priorities, and the clashes between new and old institutional logics. Greater openness and transparency do not necessarily improve understanding. In this editorial we argue that through unravelling the imperceptibility, materiality and governmentality of how algorithms work , we can better tackl","author":[{"family":"Janssen","given":"Marijn"},{"family":"Kuk","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"Janssen:2016","container-title":"Government Information Quarterly","ISSN":"0740624X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"371 - 377","title":"The challenges and limits of big data algorithms in technocratic governance.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lls&AN=118421851&site=ehost-live","volume":"33"},

Through an analysis of ethnographic data, this article considers the everyday use of screenshots among teenagers. I examine the taking, possession, and circulation of screenshots among teens to ask: What is screenshot? What function do they have? and How are screenshots significant beyond teens? The article draws attention to the ‘social life’ that screenshots have beyond their duplicative function. Screenshots were framed by teens as an everyday aspect of digital communication that are integral to negotiating hierarchies of friendship, power, and for establishing peer trust. This article takes screenshots seriously in their own right, drawing on existing insights from feminist media studies to demonstrate how the visibility afforded by screenshots is gendered in practice. This article explores screenshots as powerful communicative tools and as a socio-cultural phenomenon worthy of further interrogation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaynes","given":"Victoria"}],"citation-key":"jaynesSocialLifeScreenshots2020","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819878806","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1378-1393","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The social life of screenshots: the power of visibility in teen friendship groups","title-short":"The social life of screenshots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819878806","volume":"22"},

In recent years, platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have deplatformed many offensiveinfluencers to curb the spread of offensive speech. We present a case study of three high-profile influencerswho were deplatformed on Twitter—Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Owen Benjamin. Working withover 49M tweets, we found that deplatforming significantly reduced the number of conversations about allthree influencers o\nn Twitter. Further, analyzing the Twitter-wide activity of these influencers’ supporters, weshow that the overall activity and toxicity levels of supporters declined after deplatforming.

  {"id":"kaerleinPlayingPersonalMedia2013","abstract":"Mobile devices are ubiquitous and increasingly an integral part of everyday media usage. One remarkable development in the field of personal media (smartphones, tablet computers, etc.) is the trivialization of their interfaces and appearance, especially when compared to the complexity of the underlying software and hardware. The iPhone and its successors trump with usability, they offer simple and seemingly direct access to many functions. Software can be handled with basic hand gestures or voice control, no expert knowledge is required to use the devices. Rather, current apps and operating systems are designed for a playful approach that favours unbiased exploration. \nThe article investigates forms of the trivial in both device materiality and interface design from a media studies perspective. Pertinent philosophical positions on human-technology relationships by Günther Anders and Hans Blumenberg are discussed to explore the ramifications of a highly productive epistemology of ignorance. A focus is placed upon the process of blackboxing, a technique of invisibilization common to media technologies wherein the social and material prerequisites of a given artefact are hidden from users. The black box also serves as a model of thought to offer a way of analysing unknown complex systems as proposed in cybernetics, and it has more recently been picked up and refashioned in significant ways in actor-network theory. \nPlaying with personal media is situated between the poles of user infantilization and the freedom of exploring new practices. Triviality in interface design is ambiguous in that it denies insight into more fundamental processes but at the same time creates a space for playful variation not requiring professional knowledge. The article aims to negotiate between positions of elitist criticism and affirmative technophilia, which are widespread in the discourse on mobile devices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kærlein","given":"Timo"}],"citation-key":"kaerleinPlayingPersonalMedia2013","container-title":"Culture Unbound","container-title-short":"Cult.

  {"id":"Kanhabua:2017","abstract":"Significant parts of cultural heritage are produced on the web during the last decades. While easy accessibility to the current web is a good baseline, optimal access to the past web faces several challenges. This includes dealing with large-scale web archive collections and lacking of usage logs that contain implicit human feedback most relevant for today's web search. In this paper, we propose an entity-oriented search system to support retrieval and analytics on the Internet Archive. We use Bing to retrieve a ranked list of results from the current web. In addition, we link retrieved results to the WayBack Machine; thus allowing keyword search on the Internet Archive without processing and indexing its raw archived content. Our search system complements existing web archive search tools through a user-friendly interface, which comes close to the functionalities of modern web search engines (e.g., keyword search, query auto-completion and related query suggestion), and provides a great benefit of taking user feedback on the current web into account also for web archive search. Through extensive experiments, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses in order to provide insights that enable further research on and practical applications of web archives.","author":[{"family":"Kanhabua","given":"Nattiya"},{"family":"Kemkes","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Nejdl","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tu Ngoc"},{"family":"Reis","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Nam Khanh"}],"citation-key":"Kanhabua:2017","container-title":"20th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries, TPDL 2016, Proceedings, pp 147-160","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"title":"How to search the internet archive without indexing it","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08256"},

  {"id":"karaganisShadowLibrariesAccess2018","abstract":"This collection looks at how university students in Russia, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, Brazil, India, and Uruguay get the books and articles they need for their education. The death of Aaron Swartz and the more recent controversy around the SciHub and Libgen repositories have drawn attention to the question of access to knowledge, particularly for students facing financial and other constraints. Open access currently provides a very limited answer to this question, which piracy answers more comprehensively. This edited volume explores how access to knowledge has changed in the past twenty years, as student populations have boomed and as educators and publishers navigated the transition from paper to digital materials. It is concerned primarily with the experience of developing countries, where growing numbers of students, rapid development of Internet and device infrastructures, and high relative inequality have produced the sharpest tensions in the publishing and educational ecosystem","call-number":"Z286.S37 S48 2018","citation-key":"karaganisShadowLibrariesAccess2018","editor":[{"family":"Karaganis","given":"Joe"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, MA : Ottawa, ON","ISBN":"978-0-262-53501-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"The MIT Press ; International Development Research Centre","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA : Ottawa, ON","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Shadow libraries: access to knowledge in global higher education","title-short":"Shadow libraries","type":"book"},

It provides a case study of a large agile development project and focusses on how customers and users participated in agile development and design activities in practice. The investigated project utilized the agile method eXtreme Programming. Planning games, user stories and story cards, working software, and acceptance tests structured the customer and user involvement. We found genuine customer and user involvement in the design activities in the form of both direct and indirect participation in the agile development project. The involved customer representatives played informative, consultative, and participative roles in the project. This led to their functional empowerment-- the users were enabled to carry out their work to their own satisfaction and in an effective, efficient, and economical manner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kautz","given":"Karlheinz"}],"citation-key":"kautzParticipatoryDesignActivities2010","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-12113-5_18","event-title":"IFIP WG 8.2/8.6 InternationalWorking Conference on Human Benefit through the Diffusion of Information Systems Design Science Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3,30]]},"language":"en","page":"303","publisher":"Springer","source":"hal.inria.fr","title":"Participatory Design Activities and Agile Software Development","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01060407","volume":"AICT-318"},

Given the increasing need for and use of crawled and archived web re- sources, discovery of individual records as well as sharing of entire holdings are pressing use cases. We investigate Bloom Filters (BFs) and their applicability to address these use cases. We experiment with and analyze parameters for their creation, measure their per- formance, outline an approach for scalability, and describe various pilot implementations that showcase their potential to meet our needs. BFs come with beneficial characteristics and hence have en- joyed popularity in various domains. We highlight their suitability for web archiving use cases and how they can contribute to very fast and accurate search services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Klein","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Balakireva","given":"Lyudmila"},{"family":"Holub","given":"Karolina"},{"family":"Celjak","given":"Draženko"},{"family":"Rudomino","given":"Ingeborg"}],"citation-key":"kleinInvestigatingBloomFilters2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the 22nd ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","DOI":"10.1145/3529372.3530934","event-place":"Cologne Germany","event-title":"JCDL '22: The ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in 2022","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9345-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,20]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Cologne Germany","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Investigating bloom filters for web archives' holdings","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529372.3530934"},

The enormity of the predicaments we are facing, global climate change and resource scarcity, together with the social, cultural and  ational settings in which we are facing these predicaments, are seriously hampering our possibility to address them. We argue that without confronting the underlying psychology that perpetuates our current state of unsustainability, there is little computing can hope to achieve. Furthermore, we also argue that these pscchological limits to computing do not only concern the users of our systems, often portrayed as the people in need of behavioral change, but also ourselves, as researchers within computing. In this paper we start exploring what these psy-chological limits could be, what ideas computing for sustainability has tried but should now retire, and start discussing a way forward.","author":[{"family":"Knowles","given":"Bran"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Elina"}],"citation-key":"Knowles:2015","container-title":"LIMITS '15","event-place":"Irvine, California","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher-place":"Irvine, California","title":"Deviant and Guilt-Ridden: Computing Within Psychological Limits","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://computingwithinlimits.org/2015/papers/limits2015-knowles.pdf"},

  {"id":"Koopman:2024","abstract":"Data increasingly drive our lives. Often presented as a new trajectory, the deep immersion of our lives in data has a history that is well over a century old. By revisiting the work of early pioneers of what would today be called data science, we can bring into view both assumptions that fund our data-driven moment as well as alternative relations to data. I here excavate insights by contrasting a seemingly unlikely pair of early data technologists, Francis Galton and W.E.B. Du Bois. Galton, well known for his contributions to eugenics, was first and foremost a tinkering technician of measure.

Moved by a lifelong love for the Tao Te Ching, the novelist and poet Ursula K. Le Guin has been working on this version of the text since the 1950s. Scholar J.P. Seaton has added expert linguistic guidance to her work, bringing to it an equally passionate commitment to scholarly accuracy. Together they have created a translation that is unlike any seen before. Le Guin's version captures all the brilliance of Lao Tzu's poetry while conveying with immediacy and clarity the astonishing depth of his spiritual insights. It also corrects many of the distorted views of Lao Tzu's philosophy, freeing it from gender-bias and revealing its universal relevance. This new version is sure to be welcomed by the many readers of the Tao Te Ching, as well as those coming to the text for the first time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"literal":"Laozi"},{"family":"Le Guin","given":"Ursula K"},{"family":"Seaton","given":"Jerome P"}],"citation-key":"laoziTaoTeChing1997","event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"978-0-8348-2463-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 607035999","publisher":"Shambhala","publisher-place":"Boston","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Tao te ching: a book about the way and the power of the way","title-short":"Tao te ching","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gIbXAAAAMAAJ"},

It starts with a discussion of a central theme in Latour’s work, that of war and, more generally, opposition and conflicts, and connects it with questions of representation, delegation and decision-making. The preoccupation with land and territories found in Latour’s latest work is an invitation to extend his notion of constitution and turn it into a situated matter of critical inquiry. The paper builds on debates and controversies surrounding mineral resources to show the analytical and critical value of constitutional analysis, and the way it can illuminate the ontological and normative issues associated with contemporary problematizations of land and territories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Laurent","given":"Brice"}],"citation-key":"Laurent:2024","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/02632764241275466","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"02632764241275466","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Latour and the Question of Politics: A Constitutional Reading","title-short":"Latour and the Question of Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02632764241275466"},

  {"id":"lazemChallengesParadoxesDecolonising2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The preponderance of Western methods, practices, standards, and classifications in the manner in which new technology-related knowledge is created and globalised has led to calls for more inclusive approaches to design. A decolonisation project is concerned with how researchers might contribute to dismantling and re-envisioning existing power relations, resisting past biases, and balancing Western heavy influences in technology design by foregrounding the authentic voices of the indigenous people in the entire design process. We examine how the establishment of local Global South HCI communities (AfriCHI and ArabHCI) has led to the enactment of decolonisation practices. Specifically, we seek to uncover how decolonisation is perceived in the AfriCHI and ArabHCI communities as well as the extent to which both communities are engaged with the idea of decolonisation without necessarily using the term. We drew from the relevant literature, our own outsider/insider lived experiences, and the communities’ responses to an online anonymised survey to highlight three problematic but interrelated practical paradoxes: a terminology, an ethical, and a micro-colonisation paradox. We argue that these paradoxes expose the dilemmas faced by local non-Western researchers as they pursue decolonisation thinking. This article offers a blended perspective on the decolonisation debate in HCI, CSCW, and the practice-based CSCW scholarly communities and invites researchers to examine their research work using a decolonisation lens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazem","given":"Shaimaa"},{"family":"Giglitto","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Nkwo","given":"Makuochi Samuel"},{"family":"Mthoko","given":"Hafeni"},{"family":"Upani","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Anicia"}],"citation-key":"lazemChallengesParadoxesDecolonising2021","container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","container-title-short":"Comput Supported Coop Work","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0","ISSN":"0925-9724, 1573-7551","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,24]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI: A Critical Discussion","title-short":"Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0"},

  {"id":"Loukissas:2019","abstract":"In our data-driven society, it is too easy to assume the transparency of data. Instead, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local, we should approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans and their dutiful machines, at a time, in a place, with the instruments at hand, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term data set implies something discrete, complete, and portable, but it is none of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for understanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, the Digital Public Library of America, UCLA's Television News Archive, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six principles: all data are local; data have complex attachments to place; data are collected from heterogeneous sources; data and algorithms are inextricably entangled; interfaces recontextualize data; and data are indexes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to follow. To make his argument, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitative research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutting the “myth of digital universalism,” Loukissas reminds us of the meaning-making power of the local.","author":[{"literal":"Yanni Alexander Loukissas"}],"citation-key":"Loukissas:2019","ISBN":"978-0-262-03966-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"272","publisher":"MIT Press","title":"All Data are Local","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Luccioni:2023","abstract":"Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of ``generality'' comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Luccioni","given":"Alexandra Sasha"},{"family":"Jernite","given":"Yacine"},{"family":"Strubell","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"Luccioni:2023","DOI":"10.1145/3630106.3658542","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Power Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?","title-short":"Power Hungry Processing","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16863"},

  {"id":"macaskillWhatWeOwe2022","abstract":"\"One of the most stunning achievements of moral philosophy is something we take for granted: moral universalism, or the idea that every human has equal moral worth. In What We Owe the Future, Oxford philosopher William MacAskill demands that we go a step further, arguing that people not only have equal moral worth no matter where or how they live, but also no matter when they live. This idea has implications beyond the obvious (climate change) - including literally making sure that there are people in the future: It's not unusual to hear someone way, \"Oh, I could never bring a child into this world.\" MacAskill argues that the sentiment itself may well be immoral: we have a responsibility not just to consider whether the world of the future will be suitable for supporting humans, but to act to make sure there are humans in it. And while it may seem that the destructive capacity of modern industrial technology means that we ought to eschew it as much as possible, MacAskill argues for optimism in our ability to (eventually) get technology right, for the future's benefit, and ours. Where Hans Rosling's Factfulness and Rutger Bregman's Utopia for Realists gave us reasons for hope and action in the present, What We Owe the Future is a compelling and accessible argument for why solving our problems demands that we worry about the future. And ultimately it provides an answer to the most important question we humans face: can we not just endure, but thrive?\"--","author":[{"family":"MacAskill","given":"William"}],"call-number":"BJ1474 .M33 2022","citation-key":"macaskillWhatWeOwe2022","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-5416-1862-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Hachette Book Group, Inc","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"What we owe the future","type":"book"},

  {"id":"maemuraAllWARCNo2023","abstract":"This paper examines the Web ARChive (WARC) file format, revealing how the format has come to play a central role in the development and standardization of interoperable tools and methods for the international web archiving community. In the context of emerging big data approaches, I consider the sociotechnical relationships between material construction of data and information infrastructures for collecting and research. Analysis is inspired by Star and Griesemer's historical case of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology which reveals how boundary objects and methods standardization are used to enroll actors in the work of collecting for natural history. I extend these concepts by pairing them with frameworks for studying digital materiality and the representational qualities of data artifacts. Through examples drawn from fieldwork observations studying two data-centered research projects, I consider how the materiality of the WARC format influences research methods and approaches to data extraction, selection, and transformation. Findings identify three modalities researchers use to configure WARC data for researcher needs: using indexes to support search queries, constructing derivative formats designed for certain types of analysis, and generating custom-designed datasets tailored for specific research purposes. Findings additionally reveal similarities in how these distinct methods approach automated data extraction by relying upon the WARC's standardized metadata elements. By interrogating whose information needs are being met and taken into account in the design of the WARC's underlying information representation, I reveal effects on the emerging field of web history, and consider alternative approaches to knowledge production with archived web data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Maemura","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"maemuraAllWARCNo2023","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517231163172","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172311631","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"All WARC and no playback: The materialities of data-centered web archives research","title-short":"All WARC and no playback","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517231163172","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Mandolessi:2021","abstract":"This article discusses the imaginary that digital memories are ‘placeless’, which refers to the notion that, among the changes that memory has experienced under the impact of digital media, one is the loss of a significant link to place. I contend that digital memories are not placeless memories, but, on the contrary, that place is central for digital memory work. Drawing on the concept of ‘performation’, I seek to demonstrate how place is created, executed and staged in the digital ecology. To illustrate this, I analyse two works of the research agency Forensic Architecture, ‘Hannibal in Rafah’ and ‘Saydnaya: Inside A Syrian Torture Prison’, in which ‘place’ plays a central role in the shaping of digital memory. Digital media’s ‘inherently archival’ nature acquires a different meaning in these works: it is the process of collecting and mapping the dispersed fragments of data that transforms the archive into memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandolessi","given":"Silvana"}],"citation-key":"Mandolessi:2021","container-title":"Memory Studies","container-title-short":"Memory Studies","DOI":"10.1177/17506980211010922","ISSN":"1750-6980, 1750-6999","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","page":"622-633","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenging the placeless imaginary in digital memories: The performation of place in the work of Forensic Architecture","title-short":"Challenging the placeless imaginary in digital memories","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17506980211010922","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"Mandolessi:2023","abstract":"This article examines the changes experienced by collective memory in the digital era. Contrary to the thesis that digital memory entails a new type of memory, which is radically different from the traditional conceptualization, I argue that the practice of digital memory materializes and implements the theoretical claims made by Memory Studies since the field’s inception – collective memory conceived as a process, mediated and remediated by multiple media, with the participation of dynamic communities that perform rather than represent the past. In the article, I address what I propose are the following four major transformations that collective memory has undergone in the digital era: (1) the new ontology of the digital archive; (2) the shift from narrative as a privileged form of collective memory to the cultural form of the database; (3) the reconfiguration of agency, in which a distributed memory is performed by human and non-human agents in a dynamic entanglement; and (4) the shift from mnemonic objects to mnemonic assemblages, comprising persons, things, artefacts, spaces, discourses, behaviours and expressions in dynamic relatedness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandolessi","given":"Silvana"}],"citation-key":"Mandolessi:2023","container-title":"Memory Studies","container-title-short":"Memory Studies","DOI":"10.1177/17506980231204201","ISSN":"1750-6980, 1750-6999","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1513-1528","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The digital turn in memory studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17506980231204201","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Michael:2020","abstract":"This entry begins by distinguishing speculative research from the broader cultural and academic meanings of “speculation.” The present “constructivist” approach to speculative research places emphasis on the ways in which the research question, the researcher, the researched and research device are actively involved in a process of becoming-with one another. This is explored through the notion of the “research event” into which a multiplicity of divergent elements (micro and the macro, the social and the material, the cognitive and the affective, and the human and the nonhuman) enters. In combining, they also “become-with” one other thereby opening the potentialities of the research event, including the possibility that it is no longer “about” research. Speculative research concerns enabling a sensibility attuned to this process of co-becoming. The entry suggests that a sensitivity to, and a taking seriously of, the “idiot” (i.e., that which does not make sense in the context of the research event as typically understood) facilitates this openness to the possibilities of the research event. More proactively, speculative researchers can also introduce idiocy into research events as a way of prompting participants to explore potential ways of reframing the research question, that is, of inventing new problems. The device of the “probe” (drawn from design practice) is used to illustrate this. It is further proposed that speculative research extends to the data analytic phase: introducing alternative materials (e.g., nonacademic artifacts) or traditions of engagement (e.g., aesthetic) can also enable “possibilistic” accounts.","author":[{"family":"Michael","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Wilkie","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"Michael:2020","container-title":"The Palgrave encyclopedia of the possible","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-98390-5_118-1","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-98390-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1–8","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","title":"Speculative research","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98390-5_118-1"},

  {"id":"Miton:2022","abstract":"A wide variety of cultural practices have a ‘tacit’ dimension, whose principles are neither obvious to an observer, nor known explicitly by experts. This poses a problem for cultural evolution: if beginners cannot spot the principles to imitate, and experts cannot say what they are doing, how can tacit knowledge pass from generation to generation? We present a domain-general model of ‘tacit teaching’, drawn from statistical physics, that shows how high-accuracy transmission of tacit knowledge is possible. It applies when the practice’s underlying features are subject to interacting and competing constraints. Our model makes predictions for key features of the teaching process. It predicts a tell-tale distribution of teaching outcomes, with some students near-perfect performers while others receiving the same instruction are disastrously bad. This differs from standard cultural evolution models that rely on direct, high-fidelity copying, which lead to a much narrower distribution of mostly mediocre outcomes. The model also predicts generic features of the cultural evolution of tacit knowledge. The evolution of tacit knowledge is expected to be bursty, with long periods of stability interspersed with brief periods of dramatic change, and where tacit knowledge, once lost, becomes essentially impossible to recover.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Miton","given":"Helena"},{"family":"DeDeo","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"Miton:2022","container-title":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","container-title-short":"J.

Never in history have conflicts over Internet governance attracted such widespread attention. High-profile controversies include the disclosures about NSA surveillance by intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, controversy over a decision by the US government to relinquish its historic oversight of Internet names and numbers, and countless cybersecurity breaches involving unauthorized access to Internet users' personal data. Much of the Internet governance ecosystemboth technical architecture and coordinating institutionsis behind the scenes but increasingly carries significant public interest implications. An area once concealed in institutional and technological complexity is now rightly bracketed among other shared global issuessuch as environmental protection and human rightsthat have considerable global implications but are simply incongruous with national borders. This transformation into an era of global governance by Internet infrastructure presents a moment of opportunity for scholars to bring these politicized infrastructures to the foreground.","author":[{"family":"Musiani","given":"Francesca","suffix":"Cogburn, Derrick L"},{"family":"DeNardis","given":"Laura","suffix":"Levinson, Nanette S"}],"citation-key":"musianiTurnInfrastructureInternet2016","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-137-48359-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1049998525","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan US :Imprint: Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Turn to Infrastructure in Internet Governance","type":"book"},

  {"id":"nembhardCollectiveCourageHistory2021","abstract":"In Collective Courage, Jessica Gordon Nembhard chronicles African American cooperative business ownership and its place in the movements for Black civil rights and economic equality. Not since W. E. B. Du Bois's 1907 Economic Co-operation Among Negro Americans has there been a full-length, nationwide study of African American cooperatives. Collective Courage extends that story into the twenty-first century. Many of the players are well known in the history of the African American experience: Du Bois, A. Philip Randolph and the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Jo Baker, George Schuyler and the Young Negroes' Co-operative League, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panther Party. Adding the cooperative movement to Black history results in a retelling of the African American experience, with an increased understanding of African American collective economic agency and grassroots economic organizing. To tell the story, Gordon Nembhard uses a variety of newspapers, period magazines, and journals; co-ops' articles of incorporation, minutes from annual meetings, newsletters, budgets, and income statements; and scholarly books, memoirs, and biographies. These sources reveal the achievements and challenges of Black co-ops, collective economic action, and social entrepreneurship. Gordon Nembhard finds that African Americans, as well as other people of color and low-income people, have benefitted greatly from cooperative ownership and democratic economic participation throughout the nation's history.","author":[{"family":"Nembhard","given":"Jessica Gordon"}],"citation-key":"nembhardCollectiveCourageHistory2021","ISBN":"9780271064260","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"In English","note":"OCLC: 1256410188","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Practice","title-short":"Collective Courage","type":"document"},

  {"id":"nofrePoliticsEarlyProgramming2021","abstract":"There probably has never been such a controversial programming language as Algol. In the early 1960s the disciplinary success of the so-called Algol project in helping to forge the discipline of computer science was not matched by a significant adoption of the Algol language, in any of its three versions. This contrast is even more striking when considering the contemporary success of IBM’s Fortran, a language that, like Algol, was also conceived for scientific computation, but unlike Algol, initially only available for IBM computers. Through extensive archival research, this article shows how the relentless pursuit of a still better language that came to dominate the agenda of the Algol project brought to the fore the tension between the research-driven dimension of the project and the goal of developing a reliable programming language. Such a strong research-oriented agenda increased IBM’s doubts about a project that the firm already felt little urge to support. Yet IBM did not want to appear as obstructing the development of either Algol or Cobol, even if these “common languages” posed a clear risk to the firm’s marketing model. The US Department of Defense’s endorsement of Cobol and the rising popularity of Algol in Europe convinced IBM to push for the use of Fortran in Western Europe in order to protect the domestic market. IBM’s action in support of Fortran reminds us of the power imbalances that have shaped computer science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Nofre","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"nofrePoliticsEarlyProgramming2021","container-title":"Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences","container-title-short":"Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences","DOI":"10.1525/hsns.2021.51.3.379","ISSN":"1939-1811","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"379-413","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"The Politics of Early Programming Languages: IBM and the Algol Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/hsns/article/51/3/379/117357/The-Politics-of-Early-Programming-LanguagesIBM-and","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"Ogden:2019","abstract":"This thesis makes visible the work of archiving the Web. It demonstrates the growing role of web archives (WAs) in the circulation of information and culture online, and emphasises the inherent connections between how the Web is archived, its future use and our understandings of WAs, archivists and the Web itself. As the first in-depth sociotechnical study of web archiving, this research offers a view into the ways that web archivists are shaping what and how the Web is saved for the future. Using a combination of ethnographic observation, interviews and documentary sources, the thesis investigates web archiving at three sites: the Internet Archive – the world’s largest web archive; Archive Team – ‘a loose collective of rogue archivists and programmers’ archiving the Web; and the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) –a community of academics, librarians and activists formed in the wake of the 2016US Presidential Election to safe-guard environmental and climate data. Through the application of practice theory, thematic analysis and facet methodology, I frame my findings through three ‘facets of web archiving’: infrastructure, culture and politics.I show that the web archival activities of organisations, people and bots are both historically-situated and embedded in the contemporary politics of online communication and information sharing. WAs are reflected on as ‘places’ where the past,present and future of the Web collapses around an evolving assemblage of sociotechnical practices and actors dedicated to enabling different (and at times, conflicting)community-defined imaginaries for the Web. WAs are revealed to be contested sites where these politics are enabled and enacted over time. This thesis therefore contributes to research on the performance of power and politics on the Web, and raises new questions concerning how different communities negotiate the challenges of ephemerality and strive to build the ‘Web they want’.","author":[{"family":"Ogden","given":"Jessica"}],"citation-key":"Ogden:2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"publisher":"University of Southampton","title":"Saving the web: Facets of web archiving in everyday practice","type":"thesis","URL":"https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/447624/"},

  {"id":"Ogden:2023","abstract":"From documenting human rights abuses to studying online advertising, web archives are increasingly positioned as critical resources for a broad range of scholarly Internet research agendas. In this article, we reflect on the motivations and methodological challenges of investigating the world’s largest web archive, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine (IAWM). Using a mixed methods approach, we report on a pilot project centred around documenting the inner workings of ‘Save Page Now’ (SPN) – an Internet Archive tool that allows users to initiate the creation and storage of ‘snapshots’ of web resources. By improving our understanding of SPN and its role in shaping the IAWM, this work examines how the public tool is being used to ‘save the Web’ and highlights the challenges of operationalising a study of the dynamic sociotechnical processes supporting this knowledge infrastructure. Inspired by existing Science and Technology Studies (STS) approaches, the paper charts our development of methodological interventions to support an interdisciplinary investigation of SPN, including: ethnographic methods, ‘experimental blackbox tactics’, data tracing, modelling and documentary research. We discuss the opportunities and limitations of our methodology when interfacing with issues associated with temporality, scale and visibility, as well as critically engage with our own positionality in the research process (in terms of expertise and access). We conclude with reflections on the implications of digital STS approaches for ‘knowing infrastructure’, where the use of these infrastructures is unavoidably intertwined with our ability to study the situated and material arrangements of their creation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogden","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Summers","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Shawn"}],"citation-key":"Ogden:2023","container-title":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","container-title-short":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","DOI":"10.1177/13548565231164759","ISSN":"1354-8565, 1748-7382","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"language":"en","page":"135485652311647","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Know(ing) Infrastructure: The Wayback Machine as object and instrument of digital research","title-short":"Know(ing) Infrastructure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565231164759"},

  {"id":"ogdenGoFishConceptualising2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Our work considers the sociotechnical and organisational constraints of web archiving in order to understand how these factors and contingencies influence research engagement with national web collections. In this article, we compare and contrast our experiences of undertaking web archival research at two national web archives: the UK Web Archive located at the British Library and the Netarchive at the Royal Danish Library. Based on personal interactions with the collections, interviews with library staff and observations of web archiving activities, we invoke three conceptual devices (\n              orientating, auditing\n              and\n              constructing\n              ) to describe common research practices and associated challenges in the context of each national web archive. Through this framework we centre the early stages of the research process that are often only given cursory attention in methodological descriptions of web archival research, to discuss the epistemological entanglements of researcher practices, instruments, tools and methods that create the conditions of possibility for new knowledge and scholarship in this space. In this analysis, we highlight the significant time and energy required on the part of researchers to begin using national web archives, as well as the value of engaging with the curatorial infrastructure that enables web archiving in practice. Focusing an analysis on these research infrastructures facilitates a discussion of how these web archival interfaces both enable and foreclose on particular forms of researcher engagement with the past Web and in turn contributes to critical ongoing debates surrounding the opportunities and constraints of digital sources, methodologies and claims within the Digital Humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogden","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Maemura","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"ogdenGoFishConceptualising2021","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Humanities","container-title-short":"Int J Digit Humanities","DOI":"10.1007/s42803-021-00032-5","ISSN":"2524-7832, 2524-7840","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Go fish’: Conceptualising the challenges of engaging national web archives for digital research","title-short":"‘Go fish’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42803-021-00032-5"},

  {"id":"parisInternetFuturesValues2020","abstract":"The Internet was conceptualized as a technology that would be capable of bringing about a better future, but recent literature in science and technology studies and adjacent fields provides numerous examples of how this pervasive sociotechnical system has been shaped and used to dystopic ends. This article examines different future imaginaries present in Future Internet Architecture (FIA) projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 2006 to 2016, whose goal was to incorporate social values while building new protocols to replace Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol to transfer and route information across the ever-expanding Internet. I examine the findings from two of the NSF’s FIA projects—Mobility First (MF) and eXpressive Internet Architecture—to understand the projects’ trajectories and values directives through their funding cycle and their projections into the future. I discuss how project documentation and participant articulations fall into the following three distinct themes about past experience and speculation: understanding the public, negotiating resources, and carrying project values into the future. I conclude that if the future Internet is to promote positive sociotechnical relationships, its architects must recognize that complex social and political decisions pervade each step of technical work and do more to honor this fact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Paris","given":"Britt"}],"citation-key":"parisInternetFuturesValues2020","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243920974083","ISSN":"0162-2439","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,24]]},"language":"en","page":"0162243920974083","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Internet of Futures Past: Values Trajectories of Networking Protocol Projects","title-short":"The Internet of Futures Past","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243920974083"},

  {"id":"pasekWorldWideWeb2023","abstract":"The climate impacts of the information and communications technology sector—and Big Data especially—is a topic of growing public and industry concern, though attempts to quantify its carbon footprint have produced contradictory results. Some studies argue that information and communications technology's global carbon footprint is set to rise dramatically in the coming years, requiring urgent regulation and sectoral degrowth. Others argue that information and communications technology's growth is largely decoupled from its carbon emissions, and so provides valuable climate solutions and a model for other industries. This article assesses these debates, arguing that, due to data frictions and incommensurate study designs, the question is likely to remain irresolvable at the global scale. We present six methodological factors that drive this impasse: fraught access to industry data, bottom-up vs. top-down assessments, system boundaries, geographic averaging, functional units, and energy efficiencies. In response, we propose an alternative approach that reframes the question in spatial and situated terms: A relational footprinting that demarcates particular relationships between elements—geographic, technical, and social—within broader information and communications technology infrastructures. Illustrating this model with one of the global Internet's most overlooked components—subsea telecommunication cables—we propose that information and communications technology futures would be best charted not only in terms of quantified total energy use, but in specifying the geographical and technical parts of the network that are the least carbon-intensive, and which can therefore provide opportunities for both carbon reductions and a renewed infrastructural politics. In parallel to the politics of (de)growth, we must also consider different network forms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasek","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Hunter"},{"family":"Starosielski","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"pasekWorldWideWeb2023","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517231158994","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172311589","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The world wide web of carbon: Toward a relational footprinting of information and communications technology's climate impacts","title-short":"The world wide web of carbon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517231158994","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"pawlicka-degerFeasibilityDocumentsCritical2022","abstract":"Documents have been increasingly recognised as important objects of investigation in Science and Technology Studies (STS); however, so far, much less attention has been given to the study of documents produced in Digital Humanities. The author proposes therefore to use the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pawlicka-Deger","given":"Urszula"}],"citation-key":"pawlicka-degerFeasibilityDocumentsCritical2022","container-title":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","container-title-short":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/13548565221111073","ISSN":"1354-8565, 1748-7382","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,18]]},"language":"en","page":"135485652211110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Feasibility documents as critical structuring objects: An approach to the study of documents in digital research production","title-short":"Feasibility documents as critical structuring objects","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565221111073"},

Photography, Music and Memory is a refreshing ethnographic study in which Michael Pickering and Emily Keightley explore how they act as vehicles or catalysts of memory. The book applies the concept of the mnemonic imagination, developed in their previous book, to the uses of these complementary technologies, showing how they contribute to three distinct yet interrelated stages in the distillation of experience. In-depth comparative studies of visual and sonic media are rare. Pickering and Keightley make amends for this in a rich, detailed study of how these particular media inform and support our individual and collective understandings of the past. They draw on the extensive fieldwork they have conducted, and discuss the various ways in which the mnemonic resources associated with photography and recorded music are integral to vernacular memory, enhancing the multiple narratives we construct in our everyday social worlds.","author":[{"family":"Pickering","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Keightley","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"pickeringPhotographyMusicMemory2015","event-place":"Houndmills; New York","ISBN":"978-1-137-44120-1 978-0-230-23851-0 978-0-230-23852-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1028607004","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"Houndmills; New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Photography, music, and memory: pieces of the past in everyday life","title-short":"Photography, music, and memory","type":"book"},

This article examines reciprocity as a concept in the archival field and shows how current reciprocal practices in archives with Native and Indigenous holdings can inform the wider field and its practice. The authors chart the emergence of reciprocity as an archival responsibility and to create fieldwide change through meaningful, community-based partnerships. They posit a continuum of institutional reciprocity, as well as how reciprocity might be seeded into the core functions of archives to bridge distances between communities and archival institutions. Inspired by recent scholarship in museum studies, the article concludes with a vision of “otherwising” to explore alternative possibilities that can be realized when we adopt reciprocity as an archival practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Punzalan","given":"Ricardo L."},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Diana E."}],"citation-key":"Punzalan:2022","container-title":"The American Archivist","DOI":"10.17723/2327-9702-85.1.30","ISSN":"0360-9081","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"30-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reciprocity: Building a Discourse in Archives","title-short":"Reciprocity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://meridian.allenpress.com/american-archivist/article/85/1/30/483435/Reciprocity-Building-a-Discourse-in-Archives","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"Raghunandan:2022","abstract":"Sensemaking is the iterative process of identifying, extracting, and explaining insights from data, where each iteration is referred to as the \"sensemaking loop.\" Although recent work observes snapshots of the sensemaking loop within computational notebooks, none measure shifts in sensemaking behaviors over time -- between exploration and explanation. This gap limits our ability to understand the full scope of the sensemaking process and thus our ability to design tools to fully support sensemaking. We contribute the first quantitative method to characterize how sensemaking evolves within data science computational notebooks. To this end, we conducted a quantitative study of 2,574 Jupyter notebooks mined from GitHub. First, we identify data science-focused notebooks that have undergone significant iterations. Second, we present regression models that automatically characterize sensemaking activity within individual notebooks by assigning them a score representing their position within the sensemaking spectrum. Finally, we use our regression models to calculate and analyze shifts in notebook scores across GitHub versions. Our results show that notebook authors participate in a diverse range of sensemaking tasks over time, such as annotation, branching analysis, and documentation. Finally, we propose design recommendations for extending notebook environments to support the sensemaking behaviors we observed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Raghunandan","given":"Deepthi"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Aayushi"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Shenzhi"},{"family":"Elmqvist","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Battle","given":"Leilani"}],"citation-key":"Raghunandan:2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,8]]},"number":"arXiv:2209.02851","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Code Code Evolution: Understanding How People Change Data Science Notebooks Over Time","title-short":"Code Code Evolution","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02851"},

  {"id":"Regehr:2023","abstract":"Video records created by perpetrators and witnesses of violent crime are increasingly used as evidence in criminal investigations and court proceedings. When these records include the sexual assault, torture, and murder of individuals, they carry significant power to harm those exposed to them, but most importantly, through repeated viewing, they continue to harm those individuals whose suffering is immortalized therein. Using case study methods, including in-depth interviews with those centrally involved in the case, interviews with criminal justice professionals currently working with video evidence of violent crime, and a review of official documents and media reports, this article examines the tragic Canadian case of serial killers Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka and the videos they recorded of their crimes. We observe that challenging decisions regarding the handling of video records of violent crime during the investigation process, the viewing of such records in court, and access to them by the public and press during the criminal justice process continue to be areas of concern and contestation, pitting principles of open justice against those of victim dignity and privacy. However, challenges regarding access to video records do not end with a trial and an ultimate verdict of guilt or innocence; rather, decisions continue to be made about the preservation or destruction, the storing and cataloguing, and access to archived material. In examining questions regarding the preservation and continued use of the records, we conclude that a responsible and ethical approach to these challenges is best achieved through what Caswell called a survivor-centred approach. We suggest that this approach should include recognizing the traumatic potentiality of records, providing safety and support to those affected, recognizing the potential of records to produce and perpetuate injustice, respecting the autonomy and decisions of survivors, and accepting and facilitating the right to be forgotten.

  {"id":"Rieder:2022","abstract":"Social media research software has come to play increasingly important roles in processes of knowledge production. While epistemological, logistical, legal, and ethical concerns put the spotlight on the software tools researchers are relying on, little attention is paid to the role of the ‘toolmaker’ beyond a vague idea of the ‘power’ wielded by those who design, develop, and maintain these technical artifacts. This paper seeks to address this role, both conceptually and with attention to practical concerns, as a form of hybrid and relational authorship. We thereby shift the focus from tool to tool-making, from artifact to practice, in an attempt to produce a different kind of ‘unblackboxing’ of tools than the somewhat overused tropes of open source code or open data. Our contribution proceeds in three steps. We first address tools and tool-making from a theoretical perspective, suggesting that their epistemological orientation reaches more deeply into the networks of research practice than words like ‘bias’ admit and proposing to consider the specific kind of hybrid authorship that emerges in this context. Calling on our own experiences as toolmakers, we then reflect on a cluster of issues where this authorial function becomes particularly visible. Here, we examine how motivations and commitments orient what a piece of software does and how it does it and discuss tool-making from the perspectives of co-development, maintenance and care, and ethics by design. We conclude by arguing that the most pressing concerns for tool-making lie in institutional arrangements that are crucial for the life of research software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieder","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Peeters","given":"Stijn"},{"family":"Borra","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"Rieder:2022","container-title":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","container-title-short":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","DOI":"10.1177/13548565221127094","ISSN":"1354-8565, 1748-7382","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,17]]},"language":"en","page":"135485652211270","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From tool to tool-making: Reflections on authorship in social media research software","title-short":"From tool to tool-making","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565221127094"},
  {"id":"riederMappingYouTube2020","abstract":"Over the past 15 years, YouTube has emerged as a large and dominant social media service, giving rise to a ‘platformed media system’ within its technical and regulatory infrastructures. This paper relies on a large-scale sample of channels (n=36M+) to explore this media system along three main lines. First, we investigate stratification and hierarchization in broadly quantitative terms, connecting to well-known tropes on structural hierarchies emerging in networked systems, where a small number of elite actors often dominate visibility. Second, we inquire into YouTube’s channel categories, their relationships, and their proportions as a means to better understand the topics on offer and their relative importance. Third, we analyze channels according to country affiliation to gain insights into the dynamics and fault lines that align with country and language.

Specifically, we assessed what works well and the challenges and risk factors these systems face in their ability to continue to successfully serve their mission and the needs of the market. In scoping this project and selecting these organizations, we intentionally included a combination of profit-seeking and not-for-profit initiatives, focusing on third-party preservation platforms rather than programmatic preservation. Because so many heritage organizations pursue the preservation imperative for their collections with increasingly limited resources, we examine not only the sustainability of the providers but also the decision-making processes of heritage organizations and the challenges they face in working with the providers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieger","given":"Oya Y."},{"family":"Schonfeld","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Sweeney","given":"Liam"}],"citation-key":"Rieger:2022","DOI":"10.18665/sr.316990","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,19]]},"publisher":"Ithaka S+R","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Effectiveness and Durability of Digital Preservation and Curation Systems","type":"report","URL":"http://sr.ithaka.org/?p=316990"},

The definition of podcasting arising from this analysis ? centring on episodic audio, convenient both to produce and experience ? takes into account recent changes, providing an up-to-date description of the term, useful for further research on the topic. It is also required to answer our second question: ?How do we design new ways to produce and listen to podcasts without denaturing the medium?? By reflecting on the essential features of podcasting and the necessity for innovation in this interdisciplinary medium, a framework of six-tensions is proposed as a means of grounding and potentially boosting innovation. Answering these questions could prove valuable for the future of podcasting, hypothesising a basis for reflection and development in both academia and industry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rime","given":"Jemily"},{"family":"Pike","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"rimeWhatPodcastConsidering2022","container-title":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/13548565221104444","ISSN":"1354-8565","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1260-1282","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What is a podcast?

  {"id":"Risi:2019","abstract":"Can events be accurately described as historic at the time they are happening? Claims of this sort are in effect predictions about the evaluations of future historians; that is, that they will regard the events in question as significant. Here we provide empirical evidence in support of earlier philosophical arguments1 that such claims are likely to be spurious and that, conversely, many events that will one day be viewed as historic attract little attention at the time. We introduce a conceptual and methodological framework for applying machine learning prediction models to large corpora of digitized historical archives. We find that although such models can correctly identify some historically important documents, they tend to overpredict historical significance while also failing to identify many documents that will later be deemed important, where both types of error increase monotonically with the number of documents under consideration. On balance, we conclude that historical significance is extremely difficult to predict, consistent with other recent work on intrinsic limits to predictability in complex social systems2,3. However, the results also indicate the feasibility of developing `artificial archivists'to identify potentially historic documents in very large digital corpora.","author":[{"family":"Risi","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Rohan"},{"family":"Connelly","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"Risi:2019","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-019-0620-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"title":"Predicting history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-019-0620-8"},

There are signiﬁcant data privacy challenges when performing collaborative data science work against such restricted data. In this paper we describe a range of causes and risks associated with restricted data along with the social, environmental, data, and cryptographic measures that may be used to mitigate such issues. We then show how these are generally inadequate for restricted data contexts and introduce the ’Data Airlock’ — secure infrastructure that facilitates ’eyes-oﬀ’ data science workloads. After describing our use-case we detail the architecture and implementation of a ﬁrst, single-organisation version of the Data Airlock infrastructure. We conclude with outcomes and learning from this implementation, and outline requirements for a second, federated version.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rolan","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Dalins","given":"Janis"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Campbell"}],"citation-key":"rolanDataAirlockInfrastructure2022","container-title":"arXiv:2203.09006 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Data Airlock: infrastructure for restricted data informatics","title-short":"The Data Airlock","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09006"},

It examines the spread of this perspective, focusing in particular on how this genealogical approach to the analysis of the conduct of each and of all has been taken up and developed in the English-speaking world. It evaluates some of the key criticisms that have been made of the analytics of governmentality and argues for the continuing productivity and creativity of these ways of analyzing the emergence, nature, and consequences of the arts of government.","author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Nikolas"},{"family":"O'Malley","given":"Pat"},{"family":"Valverde","given":"Mariana"}],"citation-key":"Rose:2006","container-title":"Annual Review of Law and Social Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105900","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"83-104","title":"Governmentality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105900","volume":"2"},

This is then complemented by the general organological perspective proposed by Bernard Stiegler.

  {"id":"Sambasivan:2022","abstract":"Field workers, like farmers and radiologists, play a crucial role in dataset collection for AI models in low-resource settings. However, we know little about how field workers’ expertise is leveraged in dataset and model development. Based on 68 interviews with AI developers building for low-resource contexts, we find that developers reduced field workers to data collectors. Attributing poor data quality to worker practices, developers conceived of workers as corrupt, lazy, non-compliant, and as datasets themselves, pursuing surveillance and gamification to discipline workers to collect better quality data. Even though models sought to emulate the expertise of field workers, AI developers treated workers as non-essential and deskilled their expertise in service of building machine intelligence. We make the case for why field workers should be recognised as domain experts and re-imagine domain expertise as an essential partnership for AI development.","author":[{"family":"Sambasivan","given":"Nithya"},{"family":"Veeraraghavan","given":"Rajesh"}],"citation-key":"Sambasivan:2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"The Deskilling of Domain Expertise in AI Development","type":"article-journal"},

It outlines the work that has already been done to address these questions, as web archiving begins to move out of its establishment phase, and then discusses seven key principles of good governance that might be adapted by and embedded within web archives: participation, consensus, accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, inclusivity and legality. The article concludes with a call to action for researchers and archivists to co-create the core values for web archives that will be required if they are to remain a vital part of our cultural heritage infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Schafer","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Winters","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"schaferValuesWebArchives2021","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Humanities","container-title-short":"Int J Digit Humanities","DOI":"10.1007/s42803-021-00037-0","ISSN":"2524-7840","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,10]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"The values of web archives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42803-021-00037-0"},

  {"id":"schneiderGovernableStacksDigital2022","abstract":"Critics have been converging around the logic of colonialism to describe the Internet economy. If we are serious about the laden language of the colonial, we should be ready to learn from struggles against pre-digital empires and colonial regimes. Although acts of insurrection may attract more attention, one thing leaders and theorists of anticolonial resistance have stressed persistently is the centrality of self-governance in everyday life as both a means and end of their movements. But the dominant platforms for online communities are not well-suited for durable self-governing. Resistance often relies on the same colonial firms it opposes. What would community-governed technologies look like? This paper introduces the concept of “governable stacks”, a framework for self-governing as resistance to digital colonialism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"schneiderGovernableStacksDigital2022","container-title":"tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

  {"id":"serresIncandescent2018","abstract":"The first translation of the volumes in Michel Serres' classic 'Humanism' tetralogy, this ambitious philosophical narrative explores what it means to be human. With his characteristic breadth of references including art, poetry, science, philosophy and literature, Serres paints a new picture of what it might mean to live meaningfully in contemporary society. He tells the story of humankind (from the beginning of time to the present moment) in an attempt to affirm his overriding thesis that humans and nature have always been part of the same ongoing and unfolding history. This crucial piece of posthumanist philosophical writing has never before been released in English. A masterful translation by Randolph Burks ensures the poetry and wisdom of Serres writing is preserved and his notion of what humanity is and might be is opened up to new audiences. --","author":[{"family":"Serres","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Burks","given":"Randolph"}],"call-number":"BD450 .S396913 2018","citation-key":"serresIncandescent2018","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-4742-9741-7 978-1-4742-9740-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: on1000582111","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","publisher-place":"London","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The incandescent","type":"book"},

  {"id":"shiltonEngagingValuesNeutrality2018","abstract":"Internet protocol development is a social process, and resulting protocols are shaped by their developers’ politics and values. This article argues that the work of protocol development (and more broadly, infrastructure design) poses barriers to developers’ reflection upon values and politics in protocol design. A participant observation of a team developing internet protocols revealed that difficulties defining the stakeholders in an infrastructure and tensions between local and global viewpoints both complicated values reflection. Further, Internet architects tended to equate a core value of interoperability with values neutrality. The article describes how particular work practices within infrastructure development overcame these challenges by engaging developers in praxis: situated, lived experience of the social nature of technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Shilton","given":"Katie"}],"citation-key":"shiltonEngagingValuesNeutrality2018","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243917714869","ISSN":"0162-2439, 1552-8251","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3]]},"language":"en","page":"247-269","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engaging Values Despite Neutrality: Challenges and Approaches to Values Reflection during the Design of Internet Infrastructure","title-short":"Engaging Values Despite Neutrality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243917714869","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"Shumailov:2023","abstract":"Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Shumailov","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Shumaylov","given":"Zakhar"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yiren"},{"family":"Gal","given":"Yarin"},{"family":"Papernot","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ross"}],"citation-key":"Shumailov:2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.17493","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget","title-short":"The Curse of Recursion","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493"},

  {"id":"Stengers:2024","abstract":"In Down to Earth, Bruno Latour addresses all inhabitants of the Earth as contemporary, all sharing a same present which he names ‘the new climatic regime’. It does not mean that Latour endorses a new type of coloniality, erasing differences in the name of the emergency. ‘Becoming Terrestrials’ is not a call for unity in order to ‘save the Earth’. It does however put into question the ‘charitable fiction’ Latour proposed in what he considered his opus magnus, the Inquiry into Modes of Existence. This paper will address the concern Latour expressed at the end of his life: has his Inquiry a future in the new climatic regime? Will the values Moderns both instaured and mistreated still matter for the ex-Moderns? This induces a reading of the Inquiry attentive to both its strategy and its partis pris, that confronts them with the radical orientation changes that mark Down to Earth. This results in a speculation about some of the rewritings Bruno Latour might have considered, had life granted him the time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stengers","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"Stengers:2024","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/02632764241275483","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"02632764241275483","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"With and after the <i>Inquiry</i> : How Do We Pragmatically Move from the Moderns to the Contemporaries?","title-short":"With and after the <i>Inquiry</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02632764241275483"},
  {"id":"stengersConstructivistReadingProcess2008","abstract":"Throughout much of his writing, Whitehead outlines a critique of what he termed the `bifurcation of nature'. This position divides the world into objective causal nature, on the one hand, with the perceptions of subjects on the other. On such a view, truth lies in a reality external to such subjects and it is the task of science to deliver clear and immediate access to this realm. Further, judgments about this external reality are the province of human subjects and it is the task of philosophy to ascertain the validity or otherwise of these. This article outlines Whitehead's attempts to develop a conception of nature (and the social) which avoids this premise; it also explains how he offers a way for contemporary theories to construct or engineer abstractions which go beyond notions of social construction or deconstruction. This article argues that not only does Whitehead offer a coherent alternative to such approaches but that the manner in which his major text ( Process and Reality ) is written reflects his commitment to the inherently constructed and constructing character of all existence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stengers","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"stengersConstructivistReadingProcess2008","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276408091985","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"language":"en","page":"91-110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Constructivist Reading of Process and Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276408091985","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"strathernRelationsAnthropologicalAccount2020","abstract":"\"In RELATIONS, Marilyn Strathern offers a deep and sustained analysis of the concept \"relations.\" Strathern traces the English language use of the term through the centuries, showing that up until the eighteenth century, relations had been limited to describing logic and epistemology and had not been used as a reference to kin (or any other social relations). As Strathern traces the historical shift and the way this reflected emerging ideas about learning and new forms of kinship, she also weaves analysis relating to knowledge-making, comparison, and social science criticism. Strathern explores these themes in eight chapters, each with their own substantive focus, but which when read together offer diverse yet interconnected reflections on the theoretical expansiveness of the concept. In weaving together analysis of kin-making and knowledge-making, she opens up new ways of thinking about the contours (and limits) of epistemic and relational possibilities of the English-speaking world. In chapter 1, Strathern analyzes how relations emerge within contexts of debate and conversation. This functions as a model to imagine what types of connections and associations emerge as a result of what Strathern calls \"knowledge exchanges.\" This leads her to analyze the relationship between anthropologists and the communities and to raise questions about the limit of ethnographic methods and knowledge-making. The final chapter, chapter 8, is concerned with the relationships between anthropologists and scholars in other disciplines, as well as the relationship between anthropology as a discipline and other disciplines. This chapter generates critical questions about the particular tools that emerge from an anthropological discussion of relations and, more specifically, an English-speaking discussion of relations. Here, Strathern suggests that English-speaking anthropologists can use relations as an analytic to better understand their disciplinary conventions, as well as think beyond these conventions to generate more critical analyses. This project will be of interest to students and scholars of anthropology and social theory\"--","author":[{"family":"Strathern","given":"Marilyn"}],"call-number":"GN345","citation-key":"strathernRelationsAnthropologicalAccount2020","event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-0934-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Relations: an anthropological account","title-short":"Relations","type":"book"},

  {"id":"summersLegibilityMachinesArchival2020","abstract":"The web is a site of constant breakdown in the form of broken links, failed businessmodels, unsustainable infrastructure, obsolescence and general neglect. Some esti­ mate that about a quarter of all links break every 7 years, and even within highly curated regions of the web, such as scholarly publishing, rates of link rot can be as high as 50%. Over the past twenty years web archiving projects at cultural heritage organizations have worked to stem this tide of loss. Yet, we still understand little about the diversity of actors involved in web archiving, and how content is selected for web archives. This is due in large part to the ontological politics of web archives, and how the practice of archiving the web takes place out of sight at the boundaries between human and technical activity. This dissertation explores appraisal practices in web archives in order to answer twomotivating research questions: 1) How is appraisal currently being enacted in web archives? 2) How do definitions of what constitutes a web archive shape the practice of appraisal? In order to answer these questions data was collected from interviews with practicing professionals in web archives, and from a year long ethnographic field study with a large federally funded archive. Method triangulation using the­ matic analysis, critical discourse analysis and grounded theory generated a thick and layered description of archival practice. The results of this analysis highlight three fundamental characteristics of appraisal in web archives: time, ontology and use. The research findings suggest that as expressions of value, appraisal decisions do notsimply occur at discrete moments in the life cycle of records. They are instead part of a diverse set of archival processes that repeat and evolve over time. Appraisal in web archives is not bound by a predefined assemblage of actors, technologies and prac­ tices. Indeed, artificially limiting our definition of what constitutes a web archive truncates our understanding of how appraisal functions in web archives. Finally, the valuation of web records is inextricably tied to their use in legibility projects, where use is not singular, but part of a genealogy of use, disuse and misuse. Appraising appraisal along these three axes of time, ontology and use provides in­sight into the web­ memory practices that condition our understanding of the past, and that also work to create our collective present and futures. Explicitly linking appraisal to the many forms of use informs archival studies pedagogy, by establish­ ing the value of records in terms of the processes they participate in, rather than as a static attribute of the records or their immediate context. As machines increasingly become users of web archives the stakes for understanding the values present in web archival platforms could not be higher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Summers","given":"Edward Hugh"}],"citation-key":"summersLegibilityMachinesArchival2020","DOI":"10.13016/U95C-QAYR","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Digital Repository at the University of Maryland","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Legibility Machines: Archival Appraisal and the Genealogies of Use","title-short":"Legibility Machines","type":"thesis","URL":"https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/26731"},
  {"id":"summersPageNowSPN2021","abstract":"spn-probe is a utility to run from cron to save a given timestamped URL in Internet Archive's Save Page Now for use as trace data in the generated WARC files created at the Internet Archive. Here is a sample crontab to that will run every 12 hours, and save the response to the data subdirectory: <pre><code>0 0,12 * * * * /hom/ed/Projects/spn-probe/probe.py https://mith.umd.edu/research/ </code></pre> The resulting file for each run will look something like below. Note how the URL that is archived has additional query parameters to identify the time of the request and the user agent. This is so the exact request can be identified in the saved WARC data without making any assumptions of how HTTP headers and the like will end up in the WARC data. If the URL you are testing with has query parameters this could interfere with the experiment. So it's best to use a URL that does not have query parameters, and will not malfunction when query parameters are used. <pre><code>{ \"started\": \"20181019212930\", \"url\": \"https://web.archive.org/save/https://mith.umd.edu/research/?t=20181019212930\", \"status_code\": 200, \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"nginx/1.13.11\", \"Date\": \"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:29:31 GMT\", \"Content-Type\": \"text/html;charset=utf-8\", \"Transfer-Encoding\": \"chunked\", \"Connection\": \"keep-alive\", \"Content-Location\": \"/web/20181019212509/https://mith.umd.edu/research/\", \"Set-Cookie\": \"JSESSIONID=8B6FB1CCAAADE85523BA8CCF7A0C97AE;

  {"id":"swedbergTheorizingSociologySocial2012","abstract":"Since World War II methods have advanced very quickly in sociology and social science, while this has not been the case with theory. In this article I suggest that one way of beginning to close the gap between the two is to focus on theorizing rather than on theory. The place where theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the basic rules for theorizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Swedberg","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"swedbergTheorizingSociologySocial2012","container-title":"Theory and Society","container-title-short":"Theor Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5","ISSN":"1573-7853","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-40","source":"Springer Link","title":"Theorizing in sociology and social science: turning to the context of discovery","title-short":"Theorizing in sociology and social science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"thoegersenResearcherAttitudesData2021","abstract":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report a study of how research literature addresses researchers' attitudes toward data repository use. In particular, the authors are interested in how the term data sharing is defined, how data repository use is reported and whether there is need for greater clarity and specificity of terminology. Design/methodology/approach To study how the literature addresses researcher data repository use, relevant studies were identified by searching Library Information Science and Technology Abstracts, Library and Information Science Source, Thomas Reuters' Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus. A total of 62 studies were identified for inclusion in this meta-evaluation. Findings The study shows a need for greater clarity and consistency in the use of the term data sharing in future studies to better understand the phenomenon and allow for cross-study comparisons. Furthermore, most studies did not address data repository use specifically. In most analyzed studies, it was not possible to segregate results relating to sharing via public data repositories from other types of sharing. When sharing in public repositories was mentioned, the prevalence of repository use varied significantly. Originality/value Researchers' data sharing is of great interest to library and information science research and practice to inform academic libraries that are implementing data services to support these researchers. This study explores how the literature approaches this issue, especially the use of data repositories, the use of which is strongly encouraged. This paper identifies the potential for additional study focused on this area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Thoegersen","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Borlund","given":"Pia"}],"citation-key":"thoegersenResearcherAttitudesData2021","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/JD-01-2021-0015","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"1-17","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Researcher attitudes toward data sharing in public data repositories: a meta-evaluation of studies on researcher data sharing","title-short":"Researcher attitudes toward data sharing in public data repositories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-01-2021-0015","volume":"78"},

  {"id":"Thomer:2020","abstract":"Although databases have been well-defined and thoroughly discussed in the computer science literature, the actual users of databases often have varying definitions and expectations of this essential computational infrastructure. Systems administrators and computer science textbooks may expect databases to be instantiated in a small number of technologies (e.g., relational or graph-based database management systems), but there are numerous examples of databases in non-conventional or unexpected technologies, such as spreadsheets or other assemblages of files linked through code. Consequently, we ask: How do the materialities of non-conventional databases differ from or align with the materialities of conventional relational systems? What properties of the database do the creators of these artifacts invoke in their rhetoric describing these systems—or in the data models underlying these digital objects? To answer these questions, we conducted a close analysis of four non-conventional scientific databases. By examining the materialities of information representation in each case, we show how scholarly communication regimes shape database materialities—and how information organization paradigms shape scholarly communication. These cases show abandonment of certain constraints of relational database construction alongside maintenance of some key relational data organization strategies. We discuss the implications that these relational data paradigms have for data use, preservation, and sharing, and discuss the need to support a plurality of data practices and paradigms.","author":[{"family":"Thomer","given":"Andrea K"},{"family":"Wickett","given":"Karen M"}],"citation-key":"Thomer:2020","container-title":"Big Data  & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951720934838","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"2053951720934838","title":"Relational data paradigms: What do we learn by taking the materiality of databases seriously?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720934838","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"thylstrupEthicsPoliticsData2022","abstract":"Individuals and communities increasingly depend on, and fill their lives with, machine cultures, in the form of both interfaces and infrastructures. This global push for machine cultures has given rise to an increasing demand for data and engendered a proliferation of public, private and public-private dataset repositories. While datasets form a foundational element of machine cultures, they rarely come into focus as objects of critical study. But in recent years a critical discursive formation on datasets has begun to emerge, which disturbs the idea of datasets as operational instruments of digital knowledge production and seek to instead ‘bring people back in’. The present article identifies these preliminary explorations as ‘critical dataset studies’ and draws on critical archival studies to articulate the ethico-political surfaced by these studies. Specifically it argues that critical dataset studies shows the need for an expanded ethical and conceptual approach to datasets that not only relies on linear notions of deletion and accountability but also on iterative frameworks of remains and response-ability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Thylstrup","given":"Nanna Bonde"}],"citation-key":"thylstrupEthicsPoliticsData2022","container-title":"Media, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Media, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/01634437211060226","ISSN":"0163-4437","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"01634437211060226","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The ethics and politics of data sets in the age of machine learning: deleting traces and encountering remains","title-short":"The ethics and politics of data sets in the age of machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437211060226"},

  {"id":"vandenmeersscheVirtualBordersInternational2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            The use of algorithmic tools by international public authorities is changing how norms are made and enacted. This seismic shift in global governance has important distributive consequences: the digital turn not only empowers specific corporate actors and forms of expertise but also entails new modes of social sorting based on the placement of people in patterns of data. This article focuses on the emergent inequalities that machine learning and data analytics thereby import in the domain of global governance. In line with the symposium’s theme, I thereby frame the importance of computational decision-making processes from a distributional, and not a procedural, perspective – from a perspective of inequality and not privacy, data protection or transparency. The empirical site for the assessment of these emergent inequalities is the ‘virtual border’. By focusing on the technological tools of data extraction and algorithmic risk assessment that are reshaping practices of border control, the article makes a dual contribution: it reveals the social hierarchies engendered by these data-driven forms of grouping and grading – captured in the novel concept of ‘associative inequality’ – and highlights the difficulty of registering or counteracting this mode of subject-making in existing legal terms. This intervention both traces the particular distributive effects of data-driven governance and signals the challenges it poses to the prospects and emancipatory promises of collectivity, solidarity and equality entertained in modernist ideals of international law. In resisting the logic of algorithmic governance, I suggest, we should strive not for transparency but for opacity, not inclusion but incomparability, not privacy but open-ended and defiant commonality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Den Meerssche","given":"Dimitri"}],"citation-key":"vandenmeersscheVirtualBordersInternational2022","container-title":"European Journal of International Law","DOI":"10.1093/ejil/chac007","ISSN":"0938-5428, 1464-3596","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,11]]},"language":"en","page":"chac007","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Virtual Borders: International Law and the Elusive Inequalities of Algorithmic Association","title-short":"Virtual Borders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ejil/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ejil/chac007/6583470"},

  {"id":"verkerkCouldComputingDigital2021","abstract":"Cloud  computing  provides  ready  access  to  data,  anywhere,  anytime  through  a  one-click connection to centralised data storage. For the user the physicality of cloud com-puting  is  reduced  to  a  browser  icon.  While  highly  convenient,  users  have  concerns  regarding privacy, security, and data surveillance, and don’t understand the technol-ogy. This suggests an imaginary of the cloud as benign, poetic and immaterial. How does the metaphor of the cloud shape how users imagine cloud computing? This  research  investigates  how  users  understand,  perceive  and  imagine  the  hidden  technology of cloud computing. Participatory design methodology was employed with groups of cloud computing users. Data was gathered using visual narrative method-ology  through  a  Cloud  Drawing  exercise  and  Follow-up  interview.  Stimulus  Images  of clouds in the arts and cloud computing industry further revealed how participants imagine the cloud. Findings informed a critical making methodology that addressed the immaterial nature of cloud computing through physical artefacts inspired by par-ticipant responses. An  exhibition  of  the  artefacts  provided  a  phenomenological  encounter  with  diverse cloud narratives for new participants’ responses. An enclosed server cabinet exploring  the  first  theme  of  Surveillance  uses  video,  Pepper’s  Ghost  magic  illusion,  and  smoke.  Viewers  observe  an  imaginary  of  mobile  connection  to  the  cloud  that  incorporates  a  panoptical  vision  from  an  all-seeing  eye  above.  The  second  themed  artefact,  Factory,  portrays  a  system-wide  imaginary  of  cloud  computing  infrastruc-ture through a network of fibre optic strands, and transparent user figurines. A third artefact, Noosphere, presents an imaginary of cloud computing as a technology that enables  knowledge  sharing  and  social  connection.  A  networked  bust  containing  an  interactive  element  empowers  the  viewer  to  distribute  light  and  knowledge  hori-zontally. The artefacts have a dual purpose – a manifestation of the critical making process, and a means to gather further participant feedback. Through critical making I intentionally used physical means to explore the dig-ital  technology  of  centralised  cloud  computing.  Photographs  and  drawings  provide  documentation of the creative process, moving the research into a digital format. The digital  capture  of  the  work  is  recorded,  while  the  physical  experience  through  light,  smoke and interactive elements is no longer possible. A final record of the artefacts and accompanying research will reside in digital form in the finite, digital shadow of the cloud, and in a physical book. This  research  highlights  the  imbalance  between  users’  imaginaries  of  the  cloud, the physical reality of the industry, and the metaphor it uses to advertise itself. While  the  growing  cloud  computing  industry,  with  a  market  total  of  US$214  billion  in 2019 alone, is driven by users’ streaming of video and music, it also enables data surveillance,  and  impacts  on  the  environment  (Gartner,  n.d.).  For  cloud  computing  companies,  including  Google,  Facebook  and  Amazon,  the  aim  is  delivery  of  a  work-ing product rather than a trusted one. My research seeks to address this imbalance through  investigating  users’  experience  of  the  cloud.  Through  cloud  artefacts  that  function as models of the cloud, this research provides a record of the human experi-ence of the invisible digital cloud.","author":[{"family":"Verkerk","given":"Jayn"}],"citation-key":"verkerkCouldComputingDigital2021","event-place":"Wellington, New Zealand","genre":"PhD","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"203","publisher":"Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington","publisher-place":"Wellington, New Zealand","title":"Could Computing as Digital Imaginary: A critical making approach to user perceptions and experiences","type":"thesis","URL":"https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Cloud_computing_as_Digital_Imaginary_A_critical_making_approach_to_user_perceptions_and_experiences/14411111"},

The toolkit from mechanism design is widely used in economics, policymaking, and now in building and managing online environments. Mechanism design has become one of the most pervasive yet inconspicuous influences on the digital mediation of social life. Its optimizing schemes structure online advertising markets and other multi-sided platform businesses. Whatever normative rationales mechanism design might draw on in its economic origins, as its influence has grown and its applications have become more computational, we suggest those justifications for using mechanism design to orchestrate and optimize human interaction are losing traction. In this article, we ask what ideological work mechanism design is doing in economics, computer science, and its applications to the governance of digital platforms. Observing mechanism design in action in algorithmic environments, we argue it has become a tool for producing information domination, distributing social costs in ways that benefit designers, and controlling and coordinating participants in multi-sided platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Viljoen","given":"Salomé"},{"family":"Goldenfein","given":"Jake"},{"family":"McGuigan","given":"Lee"}],"citation-key":"viljoenDesignChoicesMechanism2021","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517211034312","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172110343","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Design choices: Mechanism design and platform capitalism","title-short":"Design choices","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211034312","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Wang:2020a","abstract":"An ongoing project explores the extent to which artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the areas of natural language processing and semantic reasoning, can be exploited to facilitate the studies of science by deploying software agents equipped with natural language understanding capabilities to read scholarly publications on the web. The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios. How AI plays an important role in avoiding various biases and human induced errors in other data sets and how the technologies can be further improved in the future are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Kuansan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Zhihong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chiyuan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chieh-Han"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Yuxiao"},{"family":"Kanakia","given":"Anshul"}],"citation-key":"Wang:2020a","container-title":"Quantitative Science Studies","container-title-short":"Quantitative Science Studies","DOI":"10.1162/qss_a_00021","ISSN":"2641-3337","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"language":"en","page":"396-413","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Microsoft Academic Graph: When experts are not enough","title-short":"Microsoft Academic Graph","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/396-413/15572","volume":"1"},

Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company. His crew mates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realises that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that's been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance. Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian - while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.","author":[{"family":"Weir","given":"Andy"}],"citation-key":"weirProjectHailMary2021","ISBN":"978-0-593-35527-5 978-1-5291-0062-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1184684645","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Project Hail Mary","type":"book"},

  {"id":"whyteIndigenousScienceFiction2018","abstract":"Portrayals of the Anthropocene period are often dystopian or post-apocalyptic narratives of climate crises that will leave humans in horrific science-fiction scenarios. Such narratives can erase certain populations, such as Indigenous peoples, who approach climate change having already been through transformations of their societies induced by colonial violence. This essay discusses how some Indigenous perspectives on climate change can situate the present time as already dystopian. Instead of dread of an impending crisis, Indigenous approaches to climate change are motivated through dialogic narratives with descendants and ancestors. In some cases, these narratives are like science fiction in which Indigenous peoples work to empower their own protagonists to address contemporary challenges. Yet within literature on climate change and the Anthropocene, Indigenous peoples often get placed in historical categories designed by nonIndigenous persons, such as the Holocene. In some cases, these categories serve as the backdrop for allies' narratives that privilege themselves as the protagonists who will save Indigenous peoples from colonial violence and the climate crisis. I speculate that this tendency among allies could possibly be related to their sometimes denying that they are living in times their ancestors would have likely fantasized about. I will show how this denial threatens allies' capacities to build coalitions with Indigenous peoples. Inuit culture is based on the ice, the snow and the cold…. It is the speed and intensity in which change has occurred and continues to occur that is a big factor why we are having trouble with adapting to certain situations. Climate change is yet another rapid assault on our way of life. It cannot be separated from the first waves of changes and assaults at the very core of the human spirit that have come our way. Just as we are recognizing and understanding the first waves of change … our environment and climate now gets threatened. Sheila Watt-Cloutier, interviewed by the Ottawa Citizen. (Robb, 2015) In North America many Indigenous traditions tell us that reality is more than just facts and figures collected so that humankind might widely use resources. Rather, to know “it”—reality—requires respect for the relationships and relatives that constitute the complex web of life. I call this Indigenous realism, and it entails that we, members of humankind, accept our inalienable responsibilities as members of the planet's complex life system, as well as our inalienable rights. ( Wildcat, 2009 , xi) Within Māori ontological and cosmological paradigms it is impossible to conceive of the present and the future as separate and distinct from the past, for the past is constitutive of the present and, as such, is inherently reconstituted within the future. (Stewart-Harawira, 2005, 42) In fact, incorporating time travel, alternate realities, parallel universes and multiverses, and alternative histories is a hallmark of Native storytelling tradition, while viewing time as pasts, presents, and futures that flow together like currents in a navigable stream is central to Native epistemologies.

  {"id":"yorkSiliconValuesFuture2021","abstract":"\"What is the impact of surveillance capitalism on our right to free speech? The Internet once promised to be a place of extraordinary freedom beyond the control of money or politics, but today corporations and platforms exercise more control over our ability to access information and share knowledge to a greater extent than any state. From the online calls to arms in the thick of the Arab Spring to the contemporary front line of misinformation, Jillian York charts the war over our digital rights. She looks at both how the big corporations have become unaccountable censors, and the devastating impact it has had on those who have been censored. In Silicon Values, leading campaigner Jillian York, looks at how our rights have become increasingly undermined by the major corporations desire to harvest our personal data and turn it into profit. She also looks at how governments have used the same technology to monitor citizens and threatened our ability to communicate. As a result our daily lives, and private thoughts, are being policed in an unprecedented manner. Who decides the difference between political debate and hate speech? How does this impact on our identity, our ability to create communities and to protest? Who regulates the censors? In response to this threat to our democracy, York proposes a user-powered movement against the platforms that demands change and a new form of ownership over our own data\"--","author":[{"family":"York","given":"Jillian"}],"citation-key":"yorkSiliconValuesFuture2021","event-place":"Brooklyn","ISBN":"978-1-78873-880-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"Brooklyn","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Silicon Values: The Future of Free Speech Under Surveillance Capitalism","title-short":"Silicon Values","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Zittrain:2021","abstract":"Hyperlinks are a powerful tool for journalists and their readers. Diving deep into the context of an article is just a click away. But hyperlinks are a double-edged sword; for all of the internet’s boundlessness, what’s found on the web can also be modified, moved, or entirely disappeared. This often-irreversible decay of web content is commonly known as linkrot. It comes with a similar problem of content drift, or the often-unannounced changes––retractions, additions, replacement––to the content at a particular URL.  Our team of researchers at Harvard Law School has undertaken a project to gain insight into the extent and characteristics of journalistic linkrot and content drift. We examined hyperlinks in New York Times articles starting with the launch of the Times website in 1996 up through mid-2019, developed on the basis of a dataset provided to us by the Times. We focus on the Times not because it is an influential publication whose archives are often used to help form a historical record. Rather, the substantial linkrot and content drift we find here across the New York Times corpus accurately reflects the inherent difficulties of long-term linking to pieces of a volatile web.  Results show a near linear increase of linkrot over time, with interesting patterns emerging within certain sections of the paper or across top level domains. Over half of articles containing at least one URL also contained a dead link. Additionally, of the ostensibly “healthy” links existing in articles, a hand review revealed additional erosion to citations via content drift.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zittrain","given":"Jonathan L."},{"family":"Bowers","given":"John"},{"family":"Stanton","given":"Clare"}],"citation-key":"Zittrain:2021","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3833133","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,26]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3833133","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"The Paper of Record Meets an Ephemeral Web: An Examination of Linkrot and Content Drift within The New York Times","title-short":"The Paper of Record Meets an Ephemeral Web","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3833133"},
