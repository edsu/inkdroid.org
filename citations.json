  {"id":"Abbing:2021","abstract":"This paper describes how principles derived from degrowth can be a useful heuristic for designing an ICT system within energy limits. It does so by discussing the design choices behind https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com, an ongoing design research project that set out to build a ’low-tech website’. This research re-sulted in a design which is lightweight, tailored towards older and lower-powered devices, is powered by off-grid solar energy and thus designed with energy scarcity in mind. The project shows that values and frameworks theorized within the Computing within Limits community are technically applicable to practices of web development but also identifies hurdles to their more widespread applicability.","author":[{"family":"Abbing","given":"Roel Roscam"}],"citation-key":"Abbing:2021","container-title":"LIMITS '21","event":"Workshop on Computation Within Limits","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14],[2021,6,15]]},"title":"‘This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goesoffline’: a design inquiry into degrowth and ICT","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://computingwithinlimits.org/2021/papers/limits21-abbing.pdf"},

Users are presented with a Wikipedia-like interface, containing a short fantasy description of the topic and containing embedded web-links to other related subjects. Users may click on links to learn more about different topics, following an endless trail of generated pages. The GPT2 architecture is a text completion model – it has no explicit understanding of structure and it can be a challenge to integrate it with authorial intent. Nevertheless, through this work we show that it can be conditioned to learn to write about a subject and additionally to generate the topology for an encyclopedia. We refer to this technique as subject conditioning, or more generally, structural conditioning.","author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"Austin:2019","container-title":"Interactive Storytelling","event-place":"Cottonwood Canyon, Utah","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Cottonwood Canyon, Utah","title":"The Book of Endless History: Authorial Use of GPT-2 for Interactive Storytelling","type":"chapter"},

Interdisciplinary in method and international in scope, the volume draws together insights from media and communication studies, cultural studies, and science and technology studies while staging an important encounter between two distinct approaches to the temporal patterning of media infrastructures, a North American strain emphasizing the social and cultural experiences of lived time and a European tradition, prominent especially in Germany, focusing on technological time and time-critical processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,20]]},"citation-key":"Axel:2021","DOI":"10.5117/9789463727426","editor":[{"family":"Volmar","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Stine","given":"Kyle"}],"event-place":"NL Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-5075-3 978-94-6372-742-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,6]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"NL Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Media Infrastructures and the Politics of Digital Time: Essays on Hardwired Temporalities","title-short":"Media Infrastructures and the Politics of Digital Time","type":"book","URL":"https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463727426"},

  {"id":"Bajer:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The article discusses the attempt to understand a source code under the conception of philosophical hermeneutics guided by language. Based on a confrontation between H.-G. Gadamer’s and Paul Ricoeur’s philosophy, our main goal would be searching for the essence of the source code in language. Thus, a closer look is taken into cultural symbols, natural language, and artificial languages. Especially, there would be discussed the problem of abstraction, linguistic community, self-forgetfulness, vitality of formal languages, and display of individuality. This is where the cultural layer of the code can be traced, hence we may find our world-view verbal in nature. In line with the Critical Code Studies approach, in this article, the source code is treated as text. Because of its complexity, the issue should be studied within philosophical inquiry and computer science knowledge. Hence, the perspective developed here goes back to origins and provides a philosophical foundation for Critical Code Studies thinking.

  {"id":"Bastos:2021","abstract":"Literature on influence operations has identified metrics that are indicative of social media manipulation, but few studies have explored the lifecycle of low-quality information. We contribute to this literature by reconstructing nearly 3 million messages posted by 1 million users in the last days of the Brexit referendum campaign. While previous studies have found that on average only 4% of tweets disappear, we found that 33% of the tweets leading up to the referendum vote are no longer available. Only about half of the most active accounts that tweeted the referendum continue to operate publicly, and 20% of all accounts are no longer active. We tested whether partisan content was more likely to disappear and found more messages from the Leave campaign that disappeared than the entire universe of tweets affiliated with the Remain campaign. We compare these results with an assorted set of 45 hashtags posted in the same period and find that political campaigns present much higher ratios of user and tweet decay. These results are validated by inspecting 2 million Brexit-related tweets posted over a period of nearly 4 years. The article concludes with an overview of these findings and recommendations for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bastos","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"Bastos:2021","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","container-title-short":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/0002764221989772","ISSN":"0002-7642, 1552-3381","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"000276422198977","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"This Account Doesn’t Exist: Tweet Decay and the Politics of Deletion in the Brexit Debate","title-short":"This Account Doesn’t Exist","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764221989772"},

However, even though it has becomeubiquitous,  just  collecting  large-scale  social  media  data  in-volves a high degree of engineering skill set and computa-tional resources. In fact, research is often times gated by dataengineering problems that must be overcome before analy-sis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets asmeaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called “front page of the Internet,” in particularhas been the subject of numerous scientific studies. AlthoughReddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to so-cial media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technicalbarriers  to  acquisition  still  remain.  Thus,  Reddit’s  millionsof subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and billions ofcomments are at the same time relatively accessible, but timeconsuming to collect and analyze systematically.In  this  paper,  we  present  the  Pushshift  Reddit  dataset.Pushshift  is  a  social  media  data  collection,  analysis,  andarchiving  platform  that  since  2015  has  collected  Redditdata and made it available to researchers. Pushshift’s Redditdataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical databack  to  Reddit’s  inception.  In  addition  to  monthly  dumps,Pushshift  provides  computational  tools  to  aid  in  searching,aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the en-tirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes itpossible  for  social  media  researchers  to  reduce  time  spentin the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.","author":[{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Zannettou","given":"Savvas"},{"family":"Keegan","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Squire","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Blackburn","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"Baumgartner:2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the Fourteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media","event":"ProceedingsAAAI Conference on Web and Social Media","event-place":"Atlanta, Georgia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher-place":"Atlanta, Georgia","title":"The PushShift Reddit Dataset","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"ben-davidCounterarchivingFacebook2020","abstract":"The article proposes archival thinking as an analytical framework for studying Facebook. Following recent debates on data colonialism, it argues that Facebook dialectically assumes a role of a new archon of public records, while being unarchivable by design. It then puts forward counter-archiving – a practice developed to resist the epistemic hegemony of colonial archives – as a method that allows the critical study of the social media platform, after it had shut down researcher’s access to public data through its application programming interface. After defining and justifying counter-archiving as a method for studying datafied platforms, two counter-archives are presented as proof of concept. The article concludes by discussing the shifting boundaries between the archivist, the activist and the scholar, as the imperative of research methods after datafication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ben-David","given":"Anat"}],"citation-key":"ben-davidCounterarchivingFacebook2020","container-title":"European Journal of Communication","container-title-short":"European Journal of Communication","DOI":"10.1177/0267323120922069","ISSN":"0267-3231, 1460-3705","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","page":"249-264","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Counter-archiving Facebook","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0267323120922069","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"Benque:2020","abstract":"This PhD thesis utilises diagrams as a language for research and design practice to critically investigate algorithmic prediction. As a tool for practice-based research, the language of diagrams is presented as a way to\nread algorithmic prediction as a set of intricate computational geometries, and to write it through critical practice immersed in the very materials in question: data and code. From a position rooted in graphic and interaction design, the research uses diagrams to gain purchase on algorithmic prediction, making it available for examination, experimentation, and critique. The project is framed by media archaeology, used here as a methodology through which both the technical and historical \"depths\" of algorithmic systems are excavated.\n\nMy main research question asks:\n\nHow can diagrams be used as a language to critically investigate algorithmic prediction through design practice?\n\nThis thesis presents two secondary questions for critical examination, asking:\n\nThrough which mechanisms does thinking/writing/designing in diagrammatic terms inform research and practice focused on algorithmic prediction?\n\nAs algorithmic systems claim to produce objective knowledge, how can diagrams be used as instruments for speculative and/or conjectural knowledge production?\n\nI contextualise my research by establishing three registers of relations between diagrams and algorithmic prediction. These are identified as: Data Diagrams to describe the algorithmic forms and processes through which data are turned into predictions; Control Diagrams to afford critical perspectives on algorithmic prediction, framing the latter as an apparatus of prescription and control; and Speculative Diagrams to open up opportunities for reclaiming the generative potential of computation. These categories form the scaffolding for the three practice-oriented chapters where I evidence a range of meaningful ways to investigate algorithmic prediction through diagrams.\n\nThis includes, the 'case board' where I unpack some of the historical genealogies of algorithmic prediction. A purpose-built graph application materialises broader reflections about how such genealogies might be conceptualised, and facilitates a visual and subjective mode of knowledge production. I then move to producing 'traces', namely probing the output of an algorithmic prediction system|in this case YouTube recommendations. Traces, and the purpose-built instruments used to visualise them, interrogate both the mechanisms of algorithmic capture and claims to make these mechanisms transparent through data visualisations. Finally, I produce algorithmic predictions and examine the diagrammatic \"tricks,\" or 'chicanes', that this involves. I revisit a historical prototype for algorithmic prediction, the almanac publication, and use it to question the boundaries between data-science and divination. This is materialised through a new version of the almanac - an automated publication where algorithmic processes are used to produce divinatory predictions.\n\nMy original contribution to knowledge is an approach to practice-based research which draws from media archaeology and focuses on diagrams to investigate algorithmic prediction through design practice. I demonstrate to researchers and practitioners with interests in algorithmic systems, prediction, and/or speculation, that diagrams can be used as a language to engage critically with these themes.","author":[{"family":"Benque","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Benque:2020","event-place":"London","genre":"PhD Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Royal College of Art","publisher-place":"London","title":"Case board, traces, & chicanes: Diagrams for an archaeology of algorithmic prediction through critical design practice","type":"thesis"},

The rise of these gargantuan datasets has given rise to formidable bodies of critical work that has called for caution while generating these large datasets. These address concerns surrounding the dubious curation practices used to generate these datasets, the sordid quality of alt-text data available on the world wide web, the problematic content of the CommonCrawl dataset often used as a source for training large language models, and the entrenched biases in large-scale visio-linguistic models (such as OpenAI's CLIP model) trained on opaque datasets (WebImageText). In the backdrop of these specific calls of caution, we examine the recently released LAION-400M dataset, which is a CLIP-filtered dataset of Image-Alt-text pairs parsed from the Common-Crawl dataset. We found that the dataset contains, troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content. We outline numerous implications, concerns and downstream harms regarding the current state of large scale datasets while raising open questions for various stakeholders including the AI community, regulators, policy makers and data subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Birhane","given":"Abeba"},{"family":"Prabhu","given":"Vinay Uday"},{"family":"Kahembwe","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"Birhane:2021","container-title":"arXiv:2110.01963 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Multimodal datasets: misogyny, pornography, and malignant stereotypes","title-short":"Multimodal datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01963"},

  {"id":"Brand:1995","abstract":"\"Buildings have often been studied whole in space, but never before have they been studied whole in time.\" \"Architects (and architectural historians) are interested only in a building's original intentions. Most are dismayed by what happens later, when a building develops its own life, responsive to the life within. To get the rest of the story - to explore the years between the dazzle of a new building and its eventual corpse - Stewart Brand went to facilities managers and real estate professionals, to preservationists and building historians, to photo archives and to futurists. He inquired, \"What makes some buildings come to be loved?\" He found that all buildings are forced to adapt, but only some adapt gracefully.\" \"How Buildings Learn is a masterful new synthesis which proposes that buildings adapt best when constantly refined and reshaped by their occupants, and that architects can mature from being artists of space to becoming artists of time. A rich resource and point of departure, as stimulating for the general reader and home improvement hobbyist as for the building professional, the book is sure to generate ideas, provoke debate, and shake up habitual thinking.\" \"From the connected farmhouses of New England to I.M. Pei's Media Lab, from \"satisficing\" to \"form follows funding,\" from the evolution of bungalows to the invention of Santa Fe Style, from Low Road military surplus buildings to a High Road English classic like Chatsworth - this is a far-ranging survey of unexplored essential territory.\" \"More than any other human artifact, buildings improve with time - if they're allowed.

  {"id":"Bruckman:2021","abstract":"Deplatforming refers to the permanent ban of controversial public figures with large followings on socialmedia sites. In recent years, platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have deplatformed many offensiveinfluencers to curb the spread of offensive speech. We present a case study of three high-profile influencerswho were deplatformed on Twitter—Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Owen Benjamin. Working withover 49M tweets, we found that deplatforming significantly reduced the number of conversations about allthree influencers o\nn Twitter. Further, analyzing the Twitter-wide activity of these influencers’ supporters, weshow that the overall activity and toxicity levels of supporters declined after deplatforming. We contributea methodological framework to systematically examine the effectiveness of moderation interventions anddiscuss broader implications of using deplatforming as a moderation strategy.","author":[{"family":"Jhaver","given":"Shagun"},{"family":"Boylston","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Diyi"},{"family":"Bruckman","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"Bruckman:2021","container-title":"Journal of the ACM (JACM)","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"title":"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deplatforming as a Moderation Strategy on Twitter","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"Caswell:2021","abstract":"With the success of large-scale pre-training and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of languages. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly available datasets, or whether the datasets actually contain content in the languages they claim to represent. In this work, we manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness of language codes in a sixth (JW300). We find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least 15 corpora are completely erroneous, and a significant fraction contains less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality. Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-speakers of the languages in question, and supplement the human judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired by our analysis, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss the risks that come with low-quality data releases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Kreutzer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wahab","given":"Ahsan"},{"family":"Esch","given":"Daan","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Ulzii-Orshikh","given":"Nasanbayar"},{"family":"Tapo","given":"Allahsera"},{"family":"Subramani","given":"Nishant"},{"family":"Sokolov","given":"Artem"},{"family":"Sikasote","given":"Claytone"},{"family":"Setyawan","given":"Monang"},{"family":"Sarin","given":"Supheakmungkol"},{"family":"Samb","given":"Sokhar"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Papadimitriou","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Osei","given":"Salomey"},{"family":"Suárez","given":"Pedro Javier Ortiz"},{"family":"Orife","given":"Iroro"},{"family":"Ogueji","given":"Kelechi"},{"family":"Niyongabo","given":"Rubungo Andre"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Toan Q."},{"family":"Müller","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Müller","given":"André"},{"family":"Muhammad","given":"Shamsuddeen Hassan"},{"family":"Muhammad","given":"Nanda"},{"family":"Mnyakeni","given":"Ayanda"},{"family":"Mirzakhalov","given":"Jamshidbek"},{"family":"Matangira","given":"Tapiwanashe"},{"family":"Leong","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Nze"},{"family":"Kudugunta","given":"Sneha"},{"family":"Jernite","given":"Yacine"},{"family":"Jenny","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Firat","given":"Orhan"},{"family":"Dossou","given":"Bonaventure F.

  {"id":"caswellUrgentArchivesEnacting2021","abstract":"\"Urgent Archives argues that archivists can and should do more to disrupt white supremacy and hetero-patriarchy beyond the standard liberal archival solutions of more diverse collecting and more inclusive description. Grounded in the emerging field of critical archival studies, this book uncovers how dominant western archival theories and practices are oppressive by design, while looking toward the the radical politics of community archives to envision new liberatory theories and practices. Based on more than a decade of ethnography at community archives sites including the South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA), the book explores how members of minoritized communities activate records to build solidarities across and within communities, trouble linear progress narratives, and disrupt cycles of oppression. Caswell explores the temporal, representational, and material aspects of liberatory memory work, arguing that archival disruptions in time and space should be neither about the past nor the future, but about the liberatory affects and effects of memory work in the present. Urgent Archives extends the theoretical range of critical archival studies and provides a new framework for archivists looking to transform their practices. The book should also be of interest to scholars of archival studies, museum studies, public history, memory studies, gender and ethnic studies and digital humanities\"--","author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Michelle"}],"call-number":"CD3021 .C37 2021","citation-key":"caswellUrgentArchivesEnacting2021","collection-title":"Routledge studies in archives","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-367-42727-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Urgent archives: enacting liberatory memory work","title-short":"Urgent archives","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Corbett:2021","abstract":"Sustainability is a ubiquitous term today and one that is central to key environmental and social policy discussions relating to the most pressing questions faced in contemporary societies. In this paper we argue that sustainability needs to be understood in relation to social space. We do so by engaging with Pierre Bourdieu’s thinking tools as well as Edward Soja’s spatial analysis to deconstruct how differently positioned actors understand and relate to space, including how to sustain it. Drawing on focus group and interview data from a small Australian city, we use Soja’s typology to critique spatial tropes and dualistic frames common in sustainability discourses such as ecological/social, global/local, and reveal nuanced interpretations of spatial relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Beasy","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Corbett","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Corbett:2021","container-title":"Environmental Sociology","DOI":"10.1080/23251042.2021.1913320","ISSN":"null","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,14]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2021.1913320","page":"1-11","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What counts as sustainability?: a sociospatial analysis","title-short":"What counts as sustainability?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2021.1913320","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"Denton:2021","abstract":"In response to growing concerns of bias, discrimination, and unfairness perpetuated by algorithmic systems, the datasets used to train and evaluate machine learning models have come under increased scrutiny. Many of these examinations have focused on the contents of machine learning datasets, finding glaring underrepresentation of minoritized groups. In contrast, relatively little work has been done to examine the norms, values, and assumptions embedded in these datasets. In this work, we conceptualize machine learning datasets as a type of informational infrastructure, and motivate a genealogy as method in examining the histories and modes of constitution at play in their creation. We present a critical history of ImageNet as an exemplar, utilizing critical discourse analysis of major texts around ImageNet’s creation and impact. We find that assumptions around ImageNet and other large computer vision datasets more generally rely on three themes: the aggregation and accumulation of more data, the computational construction of meaning, and making certain types of data labor invisible. By tracing the discourses that surround this influential benchmark, we contribute to the ongoing development of the standards and norms around data development in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Amironesei","given":"Razvan"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Nicole","given":"Hilary"}],"citation-key":"Denton:2021","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517211035955","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172110359","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets: A critical history of ImageNet","title-short":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211035955","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Diehm:2021","abstract":"Within ethical design practices, informed user consent is a key requirement in the effort to invert the power imbalances fostered by the digital platforms that enable platform owners (organizations, governments, etc.) to build data profiles and make decisions about people. Much work has been completed by designers, activists, and aligned policymakers to translate data governance policies into plain-language and comprehensible  consent. But the question remains: How well do these efforts account for the broader socio-technical power structures inherent in all personal data collection? Through a series of interviews with advocates for individuals and communities whose lives are often dramatically affected by data surveillance, this study finds that ongoing attempts to cultivate informed consent into data-driven systems likely fall short of their stated goals. The current implementations of ethical digital consent indicate that platform designers and policymakers have an insufficient understanding of systems complexity at scale, political accountability, the power dynamics inherent to organizational politics, and the second- or third-order effects of local-first data strategies. This study documents the inherent threats and risks for consent-driven digital technologies that current approaches do not address.","author":[{"family":"Diehm","given":"Cade"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Ame"},{"family":"Bullen","given":"Georgia"}],"citation-key":"Diehm:2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"publisher":"Simply Secure & The New Design Congress","title":"The Limits to Digital Consent: Understanding the risks of ethical consent and data collection for underrepresented communities.","type":"report","URL":"https://ndc.substack.com/p/the-limits-to-digital-consent"},

Archival professional organisations in both countries attempt to confront this issue by focusing on the homogeneity of the profession, specifically through using the discourse of diversity. Thus, this keynote address, delivered at the 2017 conference of the Australian Society of Archivists in Melbourne, explores the following question: how, if at all, does diversity form part of the solution for dismantling the white supremacy of archives? It begins this inquiry by recounting the author's participation and experience with diversity projects of the Society of American Archivists, before speculating how archivists might transition away from the language of diversity and towards the language of liberation through the concept of an archive of the oppressed.

Reviewing literature from the CSCW Journal and related conferences where CSCW work is published, we reflect on the contributions that have emerged from this work. The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking. We argue that this presents a number of challenges for CSCW research moving forward: in having a greater impact on larger-scale health IT projects; broadening the scope of settings and perspectives that are studied; and reflecting on the relevance of the traditional methods in this field - namely workplace studies - to meet these challenges.","author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Geraldine"},{"family":"Ellingsen","given":"Gunnar"}],"citation-key":"Fitzpatrick:2013","container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-012-9168-0","ISSN":"1573-7551","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"609-665","title":"A review of 25 years of CSCW research in healthcare: Contributions, challenges and future agendas","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10606-012-9168-0","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"Flyverbom:2017","abstract":"Statistics have long shaped the field of visibility for the governance of development projects. The introduction of big data has altered the field of visibility. Employing Dean's “analytics of government” framework, we analyze two cases—malaria tracking in Kenya and monitoring of food prices in Indonesia. Our analysis shows that big data introduces a bias toward particular types of visualizations. What problems are being made visible through big data depends to some degree on how the underlying data is visualized and who is captured in the visualizations. It is also influenced by technical factors such as distance between mobile phone towers and the truth claims that gain legitimacy.

  {"id":"Fonseca:","abstract":"Data Science can be considered a technique or a science. As a technique, it is more interested in the “what” than in the “why” of data. It does not need theories that explain how things work, it just needs the results. As a science, however, working strictly from data and without theories contradicts the post-empiricist view of science. In this view, theories come before data and data is used to corroborate or falsify theories. Nevertheless, one of the most controversial statements about Data Science is that it is a science that can work without theories. In this conceptual paper, we focus on the science aspect of Data Science. How is Data Science as a science? We propose a three-phased view of Data Science that shows that different theories have different roles in each of the phases we consider. We focus on when theories are used in Data Science rather than the controversy of whether theories are used in Data Science or not. In the end, we will see that the statement “Data Science works without theories” is better put as “in some of its phases, Data Science works without the theories that originally motivated the creation of the data.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"Fonseca:","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24537","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/asi.24537","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Whether or when: The question on the use of theories in data science","title-short":"Whether or when","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24537","volume":"n/a"},

Avoiding sensationalist definitions that conflate the Dark Web with illicit activity or \"deep layers\" that search engines cannot crawl, Gehl focuses on anonymity and encryption as the key differences between the Dark Web and the everyday \"Clear Web\" on which both users and publishers are tracked and identified. Gehl focuses here on Dark Web systems -- Freenet, I2P, and Tor -- to reveal the wide range of activities, many of them perfectly legal and socially enlightened, that the Dark Web supports. Despite its various uses, the question of legitimacy is an essential one: who needs the Dark Web and why? To answer these questions, this book shares the perspectives of the Dark Web's creators, users, and publishers, and proposes an original theory of media legitimacy as it relates to state power, organizational propriety, and authenticity\"--","author":[{"family":"Gehl","given":"Robert W."}],"call-number":"ZA4237 .G44 2018","citation-key":"Gehl:2018","collection-title":"The information society series","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-03826-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"number-of-pages":"276","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Weaving the dark web: legitimacy on Freenet, Tor, and I2P","title-short":"Weaving the dark web","type":"book"},

In fact, the evaluation process, the indicators that the EU produces and uses to this aim, how it measures states' performance in this field are all relevant issues mirroring the idea of (digital) Europe that the EU intends to build. Drawing on previous studies that have emphasised the political aspects of measurement and the governmentality power of indicators, the authors maintain that the way the EU measures the implementation of digital policies reflects a neoliberal vision of what a digital Europe should look like; furthermore, through rankings and ratings, the EU exerts a governmentality power on member states by conducting their behaviour at a distance. After introducing the theme, the study deepens the political dimension of evaluation and unfolds its crucial connection with neoliberalisation. Then it focuses on the European case, wi","author":[{"family":"Giannone","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Santaniello","given":"Mauro"}],"citation-key":"Giannone:2019","container-title":"Information, Communication  & Society","ISSN":"1369118X","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"1889 - 1902","title":"Governance by indicators: the case of the Digital Agenda for Europe.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lls&AN=139136389&site=ehost-live","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"Hallinan:2019","abstract":"How to ethically conduct online platform-based research remains an unsettled issue and the source of continued controversy. The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user's mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user's relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making.","author":[{"family":"Hallinan","given":"Blake"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Jed R"},{"family":"Fiesler","given":"Casey"}],"citation-key":"Hallinan:2019","container-title":"New Media  & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819876944","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Unexpected expectations: Public reaction to the Facebook emotional contagion study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819876944"},

  {"id":"Hennel:2021","abstract":"One constitutional part of project management is the management of teams, their actions, and their social mechanisms. Team processes, behavior, and agile practices used by team members play important parts in the success of projects. To reap benefits from these highly interactive and social-focused practices, team members need to feel safe to speak freely. We propose a model that conceptualizes the effects of psychological safety and (social) agile practices on team performance. The proposed model combines recent research from organizational psychology and agile information systems development to provide a better understanding of the team-level effects. Our findings from three case studies conducted in two large insurance companies and one software development company suggest that social agile practices positively influence psychological safety, transparency, communication, and ultimately productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hennel","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Rosenkranz","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"Hennel:2021","container-title":"Project Management Journal","container-title-short":"Project Management Journal","DOI":"10.1177/8756972820933057","ISSN":"8756-9728, 1938-9507","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","page":"11-30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Investigating the “Socio” in Socio-Technical Development: The Case for Psychological Safety in Agile Information Systems Development","title-short":"Investigating the “Socio” in Socio-Technical Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756972820933057","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"Hutto:2014","abstract":"The  inherent  nature  of  social  media  content  poses  serious challenges  to  practical  applications  of  sentiment  analysis. We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment  analysis,  and  compare  its  effectiveness  to eleventypical    state-of-practice    benchmarks    including    LIWC, ANEW,  the  General  Inquirer,  SentiWordNet,  and  machine learning  oriented  techniques  relying  on  Naive  Bayes,  Max-imum  Entropy,  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  algo-rithms.  Using  a  combination  of  qualitative  and quantitative methods, we first  construct and empirically  validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to  sentiment  in  microblog-like  contexts.  We  then  combine these  lexical  features  with  consideration  for  five  general rules that  embody  grammatical  and  syntactical  conventions for  expressing  and  emphasizing  sentiment  intensity.  Inter-estingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the  sentiment  of  tweets,  we  find  that VADER  outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification  Accuracy = 0.96 and  0.84,  respectively),  and  generalizes  more  favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.","author":[{"family":"Hutto","given":"C.

Algorithms seldom operate on their own and their (dis)utilities are dependent on the everyday aspects of data capture, processing and utilization. However, as algorithms become increasingly autonomous and invisible, they become harder for the public to detect and scrutinize their impartiality status . Algorithms can systematically introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination, favor a political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. Yet it is difficult to hold algorithms accountable as they continuously evolve with technologies, systems, data and people, the ebb and flow of policy priorities, and the clashes between new and old institutional logics.

  {"id":"Kaerlein:2013","abstract":"Mobile devices are ubiquitous and increasingly an integral part of everyday media usage. One remarkable development in the field of personal media (smartphones, tablet computers, etc.) is the trivialization of their interfaces and appearance, especially when compared to the complexity of the underlying software and hardware. The iPhone and its successors trump with usability, they offer simple and seemingly direct access to many functions. Software can be handled with basic hand gestures or voice control, no expert knowledge is required to use the devices. Rather, current apps and operating systems are designed for a playful approach that favours unbiased exploration. \nThe article investigates forms of the trivial in both device materiality and interface design from a media studies perspective. Pertinent philosophical positions on human-technology relationships by Günther Anders and Hans Blumenberg are discussed to explore the ramifications of a highly productive epistemology of ignorance. A focus is placed upon the process of blackboxing, a technique of invisibilization common to media technologies wherein the social and material prerequisites of a given artefact are hidden from users. The black box also serves as a model of thought to offer a way of analysing unknown complex systems as proposed in cybernetics, and it has more recently been picked up and refashioned in significant ways in actor-network theory. \nPlaying with personal media is situated between the poles of user infantilization and the freedom of exploring new practices. Triviality in interface design is ambiguous in that it denies insight into more fundamental processes but at the same time creates a space for playful variation not requiring professional knowledge. The article aims to negotiate between positions of elitist criticism and affirmative technophilia, which are widespread in the discourse on mobile devices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kærlein","given":"Timo"}],"citation-key":"Kaerlein:2013","container-title":"Culture Unbound","container-title-short":"Cult.

  {"id":"Kanhabua:2017","abstract":"Significant parts of cultural heritage are produced on the web during the last decades. While easy accessibility to the current web is a good baseline, optimal access to the past web faces several challenges. This includes dealing with large-scale web archive collections and lacking of usage logs that contain implicit human feedback most relevant for today's web search. In this paper, we propose an entity-oriented search system to support retrieval and analytics on the Internet Archive. We use Bing to retrieve a ranked list of results from the current web. In addition, we link retrieved results to the WayBack Machine; thus allowing keyword search on the Internet Archive without processing and indexing its raw archived content. Our search system complements existing web archive search tools through a user-friendly interface, which comes close to the functionalities of modern web search engines (e.g., keyword search, query auto-completion and related query suggestion), and provides a great benefit of taking user feedback on the current web into account also for web archive search. Through extensive experiments, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses in order to provide insights that enable further research on and practical applications of web archives.","author":[{"family":"Kanhabua","given":"Nattiya"},{"family":"Kemkes","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Nejdl","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tu Ngoc"},{"family":"Reis","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Nam Khanh"}],"citation-key":"Kanhabua:2017","container-title":"20th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries, TPDL 2016, Proceedings, pp 147-160","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"title":"How to search the internet archive without indexing it","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08256"},

  {"id":"Karaganis:2018","abstract":"This collection looks at how university students in Russia, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, Brazil, India, and Uruguay get the books and articles they need for their education. The death of Aaron Swartz and the more recent controversy around the SciHub and Libgen repositories have drawn attention to the question of access to knowledge, particularly for students facing financial and other constraints. Open access currently provides a very limited answer to this question, which piracy answers more comprehensively. This edited volume explores how access to knowledge has changed in the past twenty years, as student populations have boomed and as educators and publishers navigated the transition from paper to digital materials. It is concerned primarily with the experience of developing countries, where growing numbers of students, rapid development of Internet and device infrastructures, and high relative inequality have produced the sharpest tensions in the publishing and educational ecosystem","call-number":"Z286.S37 S48 2018","citation-key":"Karaganis:2018","editor":[{"family":"Karaganis","given":"Joe"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, MA : Ottawa, ON","ISBN":"978-0-262-53501-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"The MIT Press ; International Development Research Centre","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA : Ottawa, ON","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Shadow libraries: access to knowledge in global higher education","title-short":"Shadow libraries","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Keightley:2015","abstract":"The two most salient technologies of remembering in everyday life are photography and recorded music. Photography, Music and Memory is a refreshing ethnographic study in which Michael Pickering and Emily Keightley explore how they act as vehicles or catalysts of memory. The book applies the concept of the mnemonic imagination, developed in their previous book, to the uses of these complementary technologies, showing how they contribute to three distinct yet interrelated stages in the distillation of experience. In-depth comparative studies of visual and sonic media are rare. Pickering and Keightley make amends for this in a rich, detailed study of how these particular media inform and support our individual and collective understandings of the past. They draw on the extensive fieldwork they have conducted, and discuss the various ways in which the mnemonic resources associated with photography and recorded music are integral to vernacular memory, enhancing the multiple narratives we construct in our everyday social worlds.","author":[{"family":"Pickering","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Keightley","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"Keightley:2015","event-place":"Houndmills; New York","ISBN":"978-1-137-44120-1 978-0-230-23851-0 978-0-230-23852-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1028607004","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"Houndmills; New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Photography, music, and memory: pieces of the past in everyday life","title-short":"Photography, music, and memory","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Loukissas:2019","abstract":"In our data-driven society, it is too easy to assume the transparency of data. Instead, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local, we should approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans and their dutiful machines, at a time, in a place, with the instruments at hand, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term data set implies something discrete, complete, and portable, but it is none of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for understanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, the Digital Public Library of America, UCLA's Television News Archive, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six principles: all data are local; data have complex attachments to place; data are collected from heterogeneous sources; data and algorithms are inextricably entangled; interfaces recontextualize data; and data are indexes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to follow. To make his argument, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitative research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutting the “myth of digital universalism,” Loukissas reminds us of the meaning-making power of the local.","author":[{"literal":"Yanni Alexander Loukissas"}],"citation-key":"Loukissas:2019","ISBN":"978-0-262-03966-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"number-of-pages":"272","publisher":"MIT Press","title":"All Data are Local","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Maemura:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Our work considers the sociotechnical and organisational constraints of web archiving in order to understand how these factors and contingencies influence research engagement with national web collections. In this article, we compare and contrast our experiences of undertaking web archival research at two national web archives: the UK Web Archive located at the British Library and the Netarchive at the Royal Danish Library. Based on personal interactions with the collections, interviews with library staff and observations of web archiving activities, we invoke three conceptual devices (\n              orientating, auditing\n              and\n              constructing\n              ) to describe common research practices and associated challenges in the context of each national web archive. Through this framework we centre the early stages of the research process that are often only given cursory attention in methodological descriptions of web archival research, to discuss the epistemological entanglements of researcher practices, instruments, tools and methods that create the conditions of possibility for new knowledge and scholarship in this space. In this analysis, we highlight the significant time and energy required on the part of researchers to begin using national web archives, as well as the value of engaging with the curatorial infrastructure that enables web archiving in practice. Focusing an analysis on these research infrastructures facilitates a discussion of how these web archival interfaces both enable and foreclose on particular forms of researcher engagement with the past Web and in turn contributes to critical ongoing debates surrounding the opportunities and constraints of digital sources, methodologies and claims within the Digital Humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogden","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Maemura","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"Maemura:2021","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Humanities","container-title-short":"Int J Digit Humanities","DOI":"10.1007/s42803-021-00032-5","ISSN":"2524-7832, 2524-7840","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Go fish’: Conceptualising the challenges of engaging national web archives for digital research","title-short":"‘Go fish’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42803-021-00032-5"},

The multichannel video installation experimented with how one memory (Trine's) can be represented in three very different ways, through algorithmic processes. We describe how this experiment troubles the everyday (mistaken) assumptions that digital archiving naturally includes the necessary codecs for future decoding of digital artifacts. We discuss what's at stake in critical (theory) discussions of data practices. Through this case, we offer an argument that from an ethical as well as epistemological perspective critical data studies can't be separated from an understanding of data as lived experience.","author":[{"family":"Markham","given":"Annette N."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Gabriel"}],"citation-key":"Markham:2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Big Data","DOI":"10.3389/fdata.2019.00035","ISSN":"2624-909X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"35","title":"Experimenting with algorithms and memory-making: Lived experience and future-oriented ethics in critical data science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fdata.2019.00035","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Matamoros-Fernandez:2020","abstract":"Over the past 15 years, YouTube has emerged as a large and dominant social media service, giving rise to a ‘platformed media system’ within its technical and regulatory infrastructures. This paper relies on a large-scale sample of channels (n=36M+) to explore this media system along three main lines. First, we investigate stratification and hierarchization in broadly quantitative terms, connecting to well-known tropes on structural hierarchies emerging in networked systems, where a small number of elite actors often dominate visibility. Second, we inquire into YouTube’s channel categories, their relationships, and their proportions as a means to better understand the topics on offer and their relative importance. Third, we analyze channels according to country affiliation to gain insights into the dynamics and fault lines that align with country and language. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the inductive character of this research, by highlighting the many follow-up questions that emerge from our findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieder","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Coromina","given":"Òscar"},{"family":"Matamoros-Fernández","given":"Ariadna"}],"citation-key":"Matamoros-Fernandez:2020","container-title":"First Monday","container-title-short":"FM","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v25i8.10667","ISSN":"1396-0466","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,16]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping YouTube","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/10667"},

  {"id":"McGuigan:2021","abstract":"Mechanism design is a form of optimization developed in economic theory. It casts economists as institutional engineers, choosing an outcome and then arranging a set of market rules and conditions to achieve it. The toolkit from mechanism design is widely used in economics, policymaking, and now in building and managing online environments. Mechanism design has become one of the most pervasive yet inconspicuous influences on the digital mediation of social life. Its optimizing schemes structure online advertising markets and other multi-sided platform businesses. Whatever normative rationales mechanism design might draw on in its economic origins, as its influence has grown and its applications have become more computational, we suggest those justifications for using mechanism design to orchestrate and optimize human interaction are losing traction. In this article, we ask what ideological work mechanism design is doing in economics, computer science, and its applications to the governance of digital platforms. Observing mechanism design in action in algorithmic environments, we argue it has become a tool for producing information domination, distributing social costs in ways that benefit designers, and controlling and coordinating participants in multi-sided platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Viljoen","given":"Salomé"},{"family":"Goldenfein","given":"Jake"},{"family":"McGuigan","given":"Lee"}],"citation-key":"McGuigan:2021","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517211034312","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"language":"en","page":"205395172110343","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Design choices: Mechanism design and platform capitalism","title-short":"Design choices","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211034312","volume":"8"},

Impact assessment is a promising model of algorithmic governance because it bundles an account of potential and actual harms of a system with a means for identifying who is responsible for their remedy. Success in governing with AIAs requires thoughtful engagement with the ongoing exercise of social and political power, rather than defaulting to self-assessment and narrow technical metrics. Without such engagement, AIAs run the risk of not adequately facilitating the measurement of, and contestation over, harms experienced by people, communities, and society","author":[{"family":"Emanuel","given":"Moss"},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Elizabeth Anne"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Ranjit"},{"family":"Elish","given":"Madeleine Clare"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"Metcalf:2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"publisher":"Data & Society","title":"Assembling Accountability: Algorithmic Assessment Impact for the Public Interest","type":"report","URL":"https://datasociety.net/library/assembling-accountability-algorithmic-impact-assessment-for-the-public-interest/"},

  {"id":"Michael:2020","abstract":"This entry begins by distinguishing speculative research from the broader cultural and academic meanings of “speculation.” The present “constructivist” approach to speculative research places emphasis on the ways in which the research question, the researcher, the researched and research device are actively involved in a process of becoming-with one another. This is explored through the notion of the “research event” into which a multiplicity of divergent elements (micro and the macro, the social and the material, the cognitive and the affective, and the human and the nonhuman) enters. In combining, they also “become-with” one other thereby opening the potentialities of the research event, including the possibility that it is no longer “about” research. Speculative research concerns enabling a sensibility attuned to this process of co-becoming. The entry suggests that a sensitivity to, and a taking seriously of, the “idiot” (i.e., that which does not make sense in the context of the research event as typically understood) facilitates this openness to the possibilities of the research event. More proactively, speculative researchers can also introduce idiocy into research events as a way of prompting participants to explore potential ways of reframing the research question, that is, of inventing new problems. The device of the “probe” (drawn from design practice) is used to illustrate this. It is further proposed that speculative research extends to the data analytic phase: introducing alternative materials (e.g., nonacademic artifacts) or traditions of engagement (e.g., aesthetic) can also enable “possibilistic” accounts.","author":[{"family":"Michael","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Wilkie","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"Michael:2020","container-title":"The Palgrave encyclopedia of the possible","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-98390-5_118-1","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-98390-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"1–8","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","title":"Speculative research","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98390-5_118-1"},

  {"id":"Miller:2012","abstract":"\"Anthropology has two main tasks: to understand what it is to be human and to examine how humanity is manifested differently in the diversity of culture. These tasks have gained new impetus from the extraordinary rise of the digital. This book brings together several key anthropologists working with digital culture to demonstrate just how productive an anthropological approach to the digital has already become. Through a range of case studies from Facebook to Second Life to Google Earth, Digital Anthropology explores how human and digital can be defined in relation to one another, from avatars and disability; cultural differences in how we use social networking sites or practise religion; the practical consequences of the digital for politics, museums, design, space and development to new online world and gaming communities. The book also explores the moral universe of the digital, from new anxieties to open-source ideals. Digital Anthropology reveals how only the intense scrutiny of ethnography can overturn assumptions about the impact of digital culture and reveal its profound consequences for everyday life. Combining the clarity of a textbook with an engaging style which conveys a passion for these new frontiers of enquiry, this book is essential reading for students and scholars of anthropology, media studies, communication studies, cultural studies and sociology.\"--Publisher's website","call-number":"P96.A56 D54 2012","citation-key":"Miller:2012","edition":"English ed","editor":[{"family":"Horst","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"}],"event-place":"London ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-85785-291-5 978-0-85785-290-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn764357614","number-of-pages":"316","publisher":"Berg","publisher-place":"London ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Digital anthropology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Nembhard:2021","abstract":"In Collective Courage, Jessica Gordon Nembhard chronicles African American cooperative business ownership and its place in the movements for Black civil rights and economic equality. Not since W. E. B. Du Bois's 1907 Economic Co-operation Among Negro Americans has there been a full-length, nationwide study of African American cooperatives. Collective Courage extends that story into the twenty-first century. Many of the players are well known in the history of the African American experience: Du Bois, A. Philip Randolph and the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Jo Baker, George Schuyler and the Young Negroes' Co-operative League, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panther Party. Adding the cooperative movement to Black history results in a retelling of the African American experience, with an increased understanding of African American collective economic agency and grassroots economic organizing. To tell the story, Gordon Nembhard uses a variety of newspapers, period magazines, and journals; co-ops' articles of incorporation, minutes from annual meetings, newsletters, budgets, and income statements; and scholarly books, memoirs, and biographies. These sources reveal the achievements and challenges of Black co-ops, collective economic action, and social entrepreneurship. Gordon Nembhard finds that African Americans, as well as other people of color and low-income people, have benefitted greatly from cooperative ownership and democratic economic participation throughout the nation's history.","author":[{"family":"Nembhard","given":"Jessica Gordon"}],"citation-key":"Nembhard:2021","ISBN":"9780271064260","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"In English","note":"OCLC: 1256410188","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Practice","title-short":"Collective Courage","type":"article"},

  {"id":"Nofre:2021","abstract":"There probably has never been such a controversial programming language as Algol. In the early 1960s the disciplinary success of the so-called Algol project in helping to forge the discipline of computer science was not matched by a significant adoption of the Algol language, in any of its three versions. This contrast is even more striking when considering the contemporary success of IBM’s Fortran, a language that, like Algol, was also conceived for scientific computation, but unlike Algol, initially only available for IBM computers. Through extensive archival research, this article shows how the relentless pursuit of a still better language that came to dominate the agenda of the Algol project brought to the fore the tension between the research-driven dimension of the project and the goal of developing a reliable programming language. Such a strong research-oriented agenda increased IBM’s doubts about a project that the firm already felt little urge to support. Yet IBM did not want to appear as obstructing the development of either Algol or Cobol, even if these “common languages” posed a clear risk to the firm’s marketing model. The US Department of Defense’s endorsement of Cobol and the rising popularity of Algol in Europe convinced IBM to push for the use of Fortran in Western Europe in order to protect the domestic market. IBM’s action in support of Fortran reminds us of the power imbalances that have shaped computer science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Nofre","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Nofre:2021","container-title":"Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences","container-title-short":"Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences","DOI":"10.1525/hsns.2021.51.3.379","ISSN":"1939-1811","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"379-413","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"The Politics of Early Programming Languages: IBM and the Algol Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/hsns/article/51/3/379/117357/The-Politics-of-Early-Programming-LanguagesIBM-and","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"Ogden:2021a","abstract":"spn-probe is a utility to run from cron to save a given timestamped URL in Internet Archive's Save Page Now for use as trace data in the generated WARC files created at the Internet Archive. Here is a sample crontab to that will run every 12 hours, and save the response to the data subdirectory: <pre><code>0 0,12 * * * * /hom/ed/Projects/spn-probe/probe.py https://mith.umd.edu/research/ </code></pre> The resulting file for each run will look something like below. Note how the URL that is archived has additional query parameters to identify the time of the request and the user agent. This is so the exact request can be identified in the saved WARC data without making any assumptions of how HTTP headers and the like will end up in the WARC data. If the URL you are testing with has query parameters this could interfere with the experiment. So it's best to use a URL that does not have query parameters, and will not malfunction when query parameters are used. <pre><code>{ \"started\": \"20181019212930\", \"url\": \"https://web.archive.org/save/https://mith.umd.edu/research/?t=20181019212930\", \"status_code\": 200, \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"nginx/1.13.11\", \"Date\": \"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:29:31 GMT\", \"Content-Type\": \"text/html;charset=utf-8\", \"Transfer-Encoding\": \"chunked\", \"Connection\": \"keep-alive\", \"Content-Location\": \"/web/20181019212509/https://mith.umd.edu/research/\", \"Set-Cookie\": \"JSESSIONID=8B6FB1CCAAADE85523BA8CCF7A0C97AE;

  {"id":"Paris:2020","abstract":"The Internet was conceptualized as a technology that would be capable of bringing about a better future, but recent literature in science and technology studies and adjacent fields provides numerous examples of how this pervasive sociotechnical system has been shaped and used to dystopic ends. This article examines different future imaginaries present in Future Internet Architecture (FIA) projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 2006 to 2016, whose goal was to incorporate social values while building new protocols to replace Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol to transfer and route information across the ever-expanding Internet. I examine the findings from two of the NSF’s FIA projects—Mobility First (MF) and eXpressive Internet Architecture—to understand the projects’ trajectories and values directives through their funding cycle and their projections into the future. I discuss how project documentation and participant articulations fall into the following three distinct themes about past experience and speculation: understanding the public, negotiating resources, and carrying project values into the future. I conclude that if the future Internet is to promote positive sociotechnical relationships, its architects must recognize that complex social and political decisions pervade each step of technical work and do more to honor this fact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Paris","given":"Britt"}],"citation-key":"Paris:2020","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243920974083","ISSN":"0162-2439","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"language":"en","page":"0162243920974083","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Internet of Futures Past: Values Trajectories of Networking Protocol Projects","title-short":"The Internet of Futures Past","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243920974083"},

  {"id":"Peters:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The preponderance of Western methods, practices, standards, and classifications in the manner in which new technology-related knowledge is created and globalised has led to calls for more inclusive approaches to design. A decolonisation project is concerned with how researchers might contribute to dismantling and re-envisioning existing power relations, resisting past biases, and balancing Western heavy influences in technology design by foregrounding the authentic voices of the indigenous people in the entire design process. We examine how the establishment of local Global South HCI communities (AfriCHI and ArabHCI) has led to the enactment of decolonisation practices. Specifically, we seek to uncover how decolonisation is perceived in the AfriCHI and ArabHCI communities as well as the extent to which both communities are engaged with the idea of decolonisation without necessarily using the term. We drew from the relevant literature, our own outsider/insider lived experiences, and the communities’ responses to an online anonymised survey to highlight three problematic but interrelated practical paradoxes: a terminology, an ethical, and a micro-colonisation paradox. We argue that these paradoxes expose the dilemmas faced by local non-Western researchers as they pursue decolonisation thinking. This article offers a blended perspective on the decolonisation debate in HCI, CSCW, and the practice-based CSCW scholarly communities and invites researchers to examine their research work using a decolonisation lens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazem","given":"Shaimaa"},{"family":"Giglitto","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Nkwo","given":"Makuochi Samuel"},{"family":"Mthoko","given":"Hafeni"},{"family":"Upani","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Anicia"}],"citation-key":"Peters:2021","container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","container-title-short":"Comput Supported Coop Work","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0","ISSN":"0925-9724, 1573-7551","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,24]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI: A Critical Discussion","title-short":"Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0"},

  {"id":"Risi:2019","abstract":"Can events be accurately described as historic at the time they are happening? Claims of this sort are in effect predictions about the evaluations of future historians; that is, that they will regard the events in question as significant. Here we provide empirical evidence in support of earlier philosophical arguments1 that such claims are likely to be spurious and that, conversely, many events that will one day be viewed as historic attract little attention at the time. We introduce a conceptual and methodological framework for applying machine learning prediction models to large corpora of digitized historical archives. We find that although such models can correctly identify some historically important documents, they tend to overpredict historical significance while also failing to identify many documents that will later be deemed important, where both types of error increase monotonically with the number of documents under consideration. On balance, we conclude that historical significance is extremely difficult to predict, consistent with other recent work on intrinsic limits to predictability in complex social systems2,3. However, the results also indicate the feasibility of developing `artificial archivists'to identify potentially historic documents in very large digital corpora.","author":[{"family":"Risi","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Rohan"},{"family":"Connelly","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"citation-key":"Risi:2019","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-019-0620-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Predicting history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-019-0620-8"},

It examines the spread of this perspective, focusing in particular on how this genealogical approach to the analysis of the conduct of each and of all has been taken up and developed in the English-speaking world. It evaluates some of the key criticisms that have been made of the analytics of governmentality and argues for the continuing productivity and creativity of these ways of analyzing the emergence, nature, and consequences of the arts of government.","author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Nikolas"},{"family":"O'Malley","given":"Pat"},{"family":"Valverde","given":"Mariana"}],"citation-key":"Rose:2006","container-title":"Annual Review of Law and Social Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105900","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"83-104","title":"Governmentality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105900","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Safari:2020","abstract":"Statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet few data scientists have formal statistical training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. The second edition of this practical guide-now including examples in Python as well as R-explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not. Many data scientists use statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R or Python programming languages, and have had some exposure to statistics but want to learn more, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format. With this updated edition, you'll dive into: Exploratory data analysis Data and sampling distributions Statistical experiments and significance testing Regression and prediction Classification Statistical machine learning Unsupervised learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruce","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bruce","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Gedeck","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Safari","given":"an O'Reilly Media Company"}],"citation-key":"Safari:2020","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1138943866","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition","type":"book","URL":"https://safarijv.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=UtNi1m1IRXgzYFIwZrhSxell9EDRaL2v&response_type=code&connection=queensland-university-of-technology&redirect_uri=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/complete/auth0-oauth2/&state=/library/view/-/ 9781492072935/?ar"},

  {"id":"Schneider:2006","abstract":"The use of the Web in U.S. political campaigns has developed dramatically over the course of the last several election seasons. In Web Campaigning, Kirsten Foot and Steven Schneider examine the evolution of campaigns' Web practices, based on hundreds of campaign Web sites produced by a range of political actors during the U.S. elections of 2000, 2002, and 2004. Their developmental analyses of how and why campaign organizations create specific online structures illuminates the reciprocal relationship between these production practices and the structures of both the campaign organization and the electoral arena. This practice-based approach and the focus on campaigns as Web producers make the book a significant methodological and theoretical contribution to both science and technology studies and political communication scholarship.Foot and Schneider explore the inherent tension between the desire of campaigns to maintain control over messages and resources and the generally decentralizing dynamic of Web-based communication. They analyze specific strategies by which campaigns mitigate this, examining the ways that the production techniques, coproducing Web content, online-offline convergence, and linking to other Web sites mediate the practices of informing, involving, connecting, and mobilizing supporters. Their conclusions about the past decade's trajectory of Web campaigning point the way to a political theory of technology and a technologically grounded theory of electoral politics.A digital installation available on the web illustrates core concepts discussed in the text of the book with examples drawn from archived campaign Web sites. Users have the opportunity to search these concepts in the context of fully operational campaign sites, recreating the Web experience of users during the election periods covered in the book.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Foot","given":"Kirsten A."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Steven M"}],"citation-key":"Schneider:2006","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","publisher":"MIT Press","title":"Web Campaigning","type":"book","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/web-campaigning"},

This article argues that the work of protocol development (and more broadly, infrastructure design) poses barriers to developers’ reflection upon values and politics in protocol design. A participant observation of a team developing internet protocols revealed that difficulties defining the stakeholders in an infrastructure and tensions between local and global viewpoints both complicated values reflection. Further, Internet architects tended to equate a core value of interoperability with values neutrality.

  {"id":"Stengers:2008","abstract":"Throughout much of his writing, Whitehead outlines a critique of what he termed the `bifurcation of nature'. This position divides the world into objective causal nature, on the one hand, with the perceptions of subjects on the other. On such a view, truth lies in a reality external to such subjects and it is the task of science to deliver clear and immediate access to this realm. Further, judgments about this external reality are the province of human subjects and it is the task of philosophy to ascertain the validity or otherwise of these. This article outlines Whitehead's attempts to develop a conception of nature (and the social) which avoids this premise; it also explains how he offers a way for contemporary theories to construct or engineer abstractions which go beyond notions of social construction or deconstruction. This article argues that not only does Whitehead offer a coherent alternative to such approaches but that the manner in which his major text ( Process and Reality ) is written reflects his commitment to the inherently constructed and constructing character of all existence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stengers","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"Stengers:2008","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276408091985","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7]]},"language":"en","page":"91-110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Constructivist Reading of Process and Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276408091985","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"Strathern:2020","abstract":"\"In RELATIONS, Marilyn Strathern offers a deep and sustained analysis of the concept \"relations.\" Strathern traces the English language use of the term through the centuries, showing that up until the eighteenth century, relations had been limited to describing logic and epistemology and had not been used as a reference to kin (or any other social relations). As Strathern traces the historical shift and the way this reflected emerging ideas about learning and new forms of kinship, she also weaves analysis relating to knowledge-making, comparison, and social science criticism. Strathern explores these themes in eight chapters, each with their own substantive focus, but which when read together offer diverse yet interconnected reflections on the theoretical expansiveness of the concept. In weaving together analysis of kin-making and knowledge-making, she opens up new ways of thinking about the contours (and limits) of epistemic and relational possibilities of the English-speaking world. In chapter 1, Strathern analyzes how relations emerge within contexts of debate and conversation. This functions as a model to imagine what types of connections and associations emerge as a result of what Strathern calls \"knowledge exchanges.\" This leads her to analyze the relationship between anthropologists and the communities and to raise questions about the limit of ethnographic methods and knowledge-making. The final chapter, chapter 8, is concerned with the relationships between anthropologists and scholars in other disciplines, as well as the relationship between anthropology as a discipline and other disciplines. This chapter generates critical questions about the particular tools that emerge from an anthropological discussion of relations and, more specifically, an English-speaking discussion of relations. Here, Strathern suggests that English-speaking anthropologists can use relations as an analytic to better understand their disciplinary conventions, as well as think beyond these conventions to generate more critical analyses. This project will be of interest to students and scholars of anthropology and social theory\"--","author":[{"family":"Strathern","given":"Marilyn"}],"call-number":"GN345","citation-key":"Strathern:2020","event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-0934-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Relations: an anthropological account","title-short":"Relations","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Summers:2020a","abstract":"The web is a site of constant breakdown in the form of broken links, failed businessmodels, unsustainable infrastructure, obsolescence and general neglect. Some esti­ mate that about a quarter of all links break every 7 years, and even within highly curated regions of the web, such as scholarly publishing, rates of link rot can be as high as 50%. Over the past twenty years web archiving projects at cultural heritage organizations have worked to stem this tide of loss. Yet, we still understand little about the diversity of actors involved in web archiving, and how content is selected for web archives. This is due in large part to the ontological politics of web archives, and how the practice of archiving the web takes place out of sight at the boundaries between human and technical activity. This dissertation explores appraisal practices in web archives in order to answer twomotivating research questions: 1) How is appraisal currently being enacted in web archives? 2) How do definitions of what constitutes a web archive shape the practice of appraisal? In order to answer these questions data was collected from interviews with practicing professionals in web archives, and from a year long ethnographic field study with a large federally funded archive. Method triangulation using the­ matic analysis, critical discourse analysis and grounded theory generated a thick and layered description of archival practice. The results of this analysis highlight three fundamental characteristics of appraisal in web archives: time, ontology and use. The research findings suggest that as expressions of value, appraisal decisions do notsimply occur at discrete moments in the life cycle of records. They are instead part of a diverse set of archival processes that repeat and evolve over time. Appraisal in web archives is not bound by a predefined assemblage of actors, technologies and prac­ tices. Indeed, artificially limiting our definition of what constitutes a web archive truncates our understanding of how appraisal functions in web archives. Finally, the valuation of web records is inextricably tied to their use in legibility projects, where use is not singular, but part of a genealogy of use, disuse and misuse. Appraising appraisal along these three axes of time, ontology and use provides in­sight into the web­ memory practices that condition our understanding of the past, and that also work to create our collective present and futures. Explicitly linking appraisal to the many forms of use informs archival studies pedagogy, by establish­ ing the value of records in terms of the processes they participate in, rather than as a static attribute of the records or their immediate context. As machines increasingly become users of web archives the stakes for understanding the values present in web archival platforms could not be higher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Summers","given":"Edward Hugh"}],"citation-key":"Summers:2020a","DOI":"10.13016/U95C-QAYR","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Digital Repository at the University of Maryland","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Legibility Machines: Archival Appraisal and the Genealogies of Use","title-short":"Legibility Machines","type":"thesis","URL":"https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/26731"},

  {"id":"Swedberg:2012","abstract":"Since World War II methods have advanced very quickly in sociology and social science, while this has not been the case with theory. In this article I suggest that one way of beginning to close the gap between the two is to focus on theorizing rather than on theory. The place where theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the basic rules for theorizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Swedberg","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Swedberg:2012","container-title":"Theory and Society","container-title-short":"Theor Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5","ISSN":"1573-7853","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-40","source":"Springer Link","title":"Theorizing in sociology and social science: turning to the context of discovery","title-short":"Theorizing in sociology and social science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Tang:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Supervised machine learning, in which models are automatically derived from labeled training data, is only as good as the quality of that data. This study builds on prior work that investigated to what extent “best practices” around labeling training data were followed in applied ML publications within a single domain (social media platforms). In this paper, we expand by studying publications that apply supervised ML in a far broader spectrum of disciplines, focusing on human-labeled data. We report to what extent a random sample of ML application papers across disciplines give specific details about whether best practices were followed, while acknowledging that a greater range of application fields necessarily produces greater diversity of labeling and annotation methods. Because much of machine learning research and education only focuses on what is done once a “ground truth” or “gold standard” of training data is available, it is especially relevant to discuss issues around the equally important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first place. This determination becomes increasingly complex when applied to a variety of specialized fields, as labeling can range from a task requiring little-to-no background knowledge to one that must be performed by someone with career expertise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Geiger","given":"R.

  {"id":"Thomer:2020","abstract":"Although databases have been well-defined and thoroughly discussed in the computer science literature, the actual users of databases often have varying definitions and expectations of this essential computational infrastructure. Systems administrators and computer science textbooks may expect databases to be instantiated in a small number of technologies (e.g., relational or graph-based database management systems), but there are numerous examples of databases in non-conventional or unexpected technologies, such as spreadsheets or other assemblages of files linked through code. Consequently, we ask: How do the materialities of non-conventional databases differ from or align with the materialities of conventional relational systems? What properties of the database do the creators of these artifacts invoke in their rhetoric describing these systems—or in the data models underlying these digital objects? To answer these questions, we conducted a close analysis of four non-conventional scientific databases. By examining the materialities of information representation in each case, we show how scholarly communication regimes shape database materialities—and how information organization paradigms shape scholarly communication. These cases show abandonment of certain constraints of relational database construction alongside maintenance of some key relational data organization strategies. We discuss the implications that these relational data paradigms have for data use, preservation, and sharing, and discuss the need to support a plurality of data practices and paradigms.","author":[{"family":"Thomer","given":"Andrea K"},{"family":"Wickett","given":"Karen M"}],"citation-key":"Thomer:2020","container-title":"Big Data  & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951720934838","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"2053951720934838","title":"Relational data paradigms: What do we learn by taking the materiality of databases seriously?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720934838","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Verkerk:2021","abstract":"Cloud  computing  provides  ready  access  to  data,  anywhere,  anytime  through  a  one-click connection to centralised data storage. For the user the physicality of cloud com-puting  is  reduced  to  a  browser  icon.  While  highly  convenient,  users  have  concerns  regarding privacy, security, and data surveillance, and don’t understand the technol-ogy. This suggests an imaginary of the cloud as benign, poetic and immaterial. How does the metaphor of the cloud shape how users imagine cloud computing? This  research  investigates  how  users  understand,  perceive  and  imagine  the  hidden  technology of cloud computing. Participatory design methodology was employed with groups of cloud computing users. Data was gathered using visual narrative method-ology  through  a  Cloud  Drawing  exercise  and  Follow-up  interview.  Stimulus  Images  of clouds in the arts and cloud computing industry further revealed how participants imagine the cloud. Findings informed a critical making methodology that addressed the immaterial nature of cloud computing through physical artefacts inspired by par-ticipant responses. An  exhibition  of  the  artefacts  provided  a  phenomenological  encounter  with  diverse cloud narratives for new participants’ responses. An enclosed server cabinet exploring  the  first  theme  of  Surveillance  uses  video,  Pepper’s  Ghost  magic  illusion,  and  smoke.  Viewers  observe  an  imaginary  of  mobile  connection  to  the  cloud  that  incorporates  a  panoptical  vision  from  an  all-seeing  eye  above.  The  second  themed  artefact,  Factory,  portrays  a  system-wide  imaginary  of  cloud  computing  infrastruc-ture through a network of fibre optic strands, and transparent user figurines. A third artefact, Noosphere, presents an imaginary of cloud computing as a technology that enables  knowledge  sharing  and  social  connection.  A  networked  bust  containing  an  interactive  element  empowers  the  viewer  to  distribute  light  and  knowledge  hori-zontally. The artefacts have a dual purpose – a manifestation of the critical making process, and a means to gather further participant feedback. Through critical making I intentionally used physical means to explore the dig-ital  technology  of  centralised  cloud  computing.  Photographs  and  drawings  provide  documentation of the creative process, moving the research into a digital format. The digital  capture  of  the  work  is  recorded,  while  the  physical  experience  through  light,  smoke and interactive elements is no longer possible. A final record of the artefacts and accompanying research will reside in digital form in the finite, digital shadow of the cloud, and in a physical book. This  research  highlights  the  imbalance  between  users’  imaginaries  of  the  cloud, the physical reality of the industry, and the metaphor it uses to advertise itself. While  the  growing  cloud  computing  industry,  with  a  market  total  of  US$214  billion  in 2019 alone, is driven by users’ streaming of video and music, it also enables data surveillance,  and  impacts  on  the  environment  (Gartner,  n.d.).  For  cloud  computing  companies,  including  Google,  Facebook  and  Amazon,  the  aim  is  delivery  of  a  work-ing product rather than a trusted one. My research seeks to address this imbalance through  investigating  users’  experience  of  the  cloud.  Through  cloud  artefacts  that  function as models of the cloud, this research provides a record of the human experi-ence of the invisible digital cloud.","author":[{"family":"Verkerk","given":"Jayn"}],"citation-key":"Verkerk:2021","event-place":"Wellington, New Zealand","genre":"PhD","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"203","publisher":"Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington","publisher-place":"Wellington, New Zealand","title":"Could Computing as Digital Imaginary: A critical making approach to user perceptions and experiences","type":"thesis","URL":"https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Cloud_computing_as_Digital_Imaginary_A_critical_making_approach_to_user_perceptions_and_experiences/14411111"},

  {"id":"Wang:2020a","abstract":"An ongoing project explores the extent to which artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the areas of natural language processing and semantic reasoning, can be exploited to facilitate the studies of science by deploying software agents equipped with natural language understanding capabilities to read scholarly publications on the web. The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios. How AI plays an important role in avoiding various biases and human induced errors in other data sets and how the technologies can be further improved in the future are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Kuansan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Zhihong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chiyuan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chieh-Han"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Yuxiao"},{"family":"Kanakia","given":"Anshul"}],"citation-key":"Wang:2020a","container-title":"Quantitative Science Studies","container-title-short":"Quantitative Science Studies","DOI":"10.1162/qss_a_00021","ISSN":"2641-3337","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2]]},"language":"en","page":"396-413","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Microsoft Academic Graph: When experts are not enough","title-short":"Microsoft Academic Graph","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/396-413/15572","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Weir:2021","abstract":"A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the Sunday Times bestselling author of The Martian. Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company. His crew mates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realises that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that's been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance. Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian - while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.","author":[{"family":"Weir","given":"Andy"}],"citation-key":"Weir:2021","ISBN":"978-0-593-35527-5 978-1-5291-0062-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1184684645","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Project Hail Mary","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Winters:2021","abstract":"This article considers how the development, promotion and adoption of a set of core values for web archives, linked to principles of “good governance”, will help them to tackle the challenges of sustainability, accountability and inclusiveness that are central to their long-term societal and cultural worth. It outlines the work that has already been done to address these questions, as web archiving begins to move out of its establishment phase, and then discusses seven key principles of good governance that might be adapted by and embedded within web archives: participation, consensus, accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, inclusivity and legality. The article concludes with a call to action for researchers and archivists to co-create the core values for web archives that will be required if they are to remain a vital part of our cultural heritage infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Schafer","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Winters","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"Winters:2021","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Humanities","container-title-short":"Int J Digit Humanities","DOI":"10.1007/s42803-021-00037-0","ISSN":"2524-7840","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,10]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"The values of web archives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42803-021-00037-0"},

The Internet once promised to be a place of extraordinary freedom beyond the control of money or politics, but today corporations and platforms exercise more control over our ability to access information and share knowledge to a greater extent than any state. From the online calls to arms in the thick of the Arab Spring to the contemporary front line of misinformation, Jillian York charts the war over our digital rights. She looks at both how the big corporations have become unaccountable censors, and the devastating impact it has had on those who have been censored. In Silicon Values, leading campaigner Jillian York, looks at how our rights have become increasingly undermined by the major corporations desire to harvest our personal data and turn it into profit. She also looks at how governments have used the same technology to monitor citizens and threatened our ability to communicate. As a result our daily lives, and private thoughts, are being policed in an unprecedented manner. Who decides the difference between political debate and hate speech? How does this impact on our identity, our ability to create communities and to protest? Who regulates the censors? In response to this threat to our democracy, York proposes a user-powered movement against the platforms that demands change and a new form of ownership over our own data\"--","author":[{"family":"York","given":"Jillian"}],"citation-key":"yorkSiliconValuesFuture2021","event-place":"Brooklyn","ISBN":"978-1-78873-880-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"Brooklyn","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Silicon Values: The Future of Free Speech Under Surveillance Capitalism","title-short":"Silicon Values","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Zanella-Beguelin:2016","abstract":"Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker.\n\nIn this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhargavan","given":"Karthikeyan"},{"family":"Delignat-Lavaud","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Fournet","given":"Cédric"},{"family":"Gollamudi","given":"Anitha"},{"family":"Gonthier","given":"Georges"},{"family":"Kobeissi","given":"Nadim"},{"family":"Kulatova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Rastogi","given":"Aseem"},{"family":"Sibut-Pinote","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Swamy","given":"Nikhil"},{"family":"Zanella-Béguelin","given":"Santiago"}],"citation-key":"Zanella-Beguelin:2016","container-title":"ACM Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security","DOI":"10.1145/2993600.2993611","event-place":"Vienna, Austria","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10]]},"publisher-place":"Vienna, Austria","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Formal Verification of Smart Contracts: Short Paper","title-short":"Formal Verification of Smart Contracts","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01400469"},

  {"id":"Zittrain:2021","abstract":"Hyperlinks are a powerful tool for journalists and their readers. Diving deep into the context of an article is just a click away. But hyperlinks are a double-edged sword; for all of the internet’s boundlessness, what’s found on the web can also be modified, moved, or entirely disappeared. This often-irreversible decay of web content is commonly known as linkrot. It comes with a similar problem of content drift, or the often-unannounced changes––retractions, additions, replacement––to the content at a particular URL.  Our team of researchers at Harvard Law School has undertaken a project to gain insight into the extent and characteristics of journalistic linkrot and content drift. We examined hyperlinks in New York Times articles starting with the launch of the Times website in 1996 up through mid-2019, developed on the basis of a dataset provided to us by the Times. We focus on the Times not because it is an influential publication whose archives are often used to help form a historical record. Rather, the substantial linkrot and content drift we find here across the New York Times corpus accurately reflects the inherent difficulties of long-term linking to pieces of a volatile web.  Results show a near linear increase of linkrot over time, with interesting patterns emerging within certain sections of the paper or across top level domains. Over half of articles containing at least one URL also contained a dead link.
