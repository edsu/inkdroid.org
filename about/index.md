👋 Hi! My name is Ed Summers and this is my weirdly named website. I'm a
[software developer] and [researcher] [working] at the intersection of
libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I'm interested in how the Web
functions as a sociotechnical system, especially with regard to memory
practices such as curation and preservation.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also find my GPG Key and some other personal identifiers over on [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/DD11F92F1E44644183C06961D012FF557AFFF80A). I'm in the Fediverse at
[\@ink@merveilles.town].

#### Projects

This is a list of projects I'm working on at the moment. It's not meant to be a
fine grained list of tasks--I use other collaborative tools for that. It's
simply a place to write down the high level things that I'm working on, in an arbitrary order, so I can see them change over time.

* scholarly publishing data analytics
* web archives research and standardization
* decentralized storage for community archives
- digital preservation services
- slowly learning Rust -- yes, still :)
- (re-)engaging with various forms of writing: documentation, journaling, blogging, poetry, and research articles perhaps?
