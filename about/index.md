Hi, my name is Ed Summers, and I am a [recovering] software developer with two
decades of [experience] working at the intersection of libraries, archives and
the World Wide Web.

I study and work with the Web as a sociotechnical system, with an eye to its
evolving architecture and practices of curation and preservation. I also help to
keep the lights on at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities].

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on Twitter as [\@edsu], Mastodon as [\@edsu@social.coop] and Scuttlebutt
as \@n2ax/dvrm+u76UhEv6aN0MzlH0Zw7o0MOd5QIHjouSw=.ed25519
