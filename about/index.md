Hi, my name is Ed Summers, and I am a [software developer] with two decades of
[experience] working at the intersection of libraries, archives and the World
Wide Web. I study and work with the Web as a sociotechnical system, with an eye
to its evolving architecture and practices of curation and preservation. I work
at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities] and am a PhD
Candidate in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on Twitter as [\@edsu], Mastodon as [\@edsu@social.coop] and Scuttlebutt
as \@n2ax/dvrm+u76UhEv6aN0MzlH0Zw7o0MOd5QIHjouSw=.ed25519

#### Projects

This is a list of projects that I'm actively working on. It's not meant to be a
fine grained list of tasks--I use other collaborative tools like Trello and
Asana for that. It's simply a place to write down the high level things that I'm
actively engaged with, in an arbitrary order, so I can get them out of my head.

* Documenting the Now Development
* Unlocking the Airwaves Development
* Lakeland Community Archive Development
* SavePageNow Research
* Bagit Python Development
* Enacting Appraisal (NSRL)
* Teaching Programming
