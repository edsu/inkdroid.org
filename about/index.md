ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Ed Summers and this is my weirdly named website. I'm
a [software developer], teacher and researcher [working] at the intersection of
libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I'm interested in how the Web
functions as a sociotechnical system, especially with regard to memory
practices such as curation and preservation. I am currently working at the
[Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities] and am affiliated with
the [College of Information Studies] at the University of Maryland.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on fediverse at [\@edsu@social.coop]. Once upon a time I was on Twitter
as [\@edsu] but I don't actively use it anymore.

#### Projects

This is a list of projects I'm working on at the moment. It's not meant to be a
fine grained list of tasks--I use other collaborative tools for that. It's
simply a place to write down the high level things that I'm actively engaged
with, in an arbitrary order, so I can see them change over time.

* Social Life of Web Archives (SLoWA)
* Documenting the Now
* Unlocking the Airwaves
* Lakeland Community Archive
* Teaching: Digital Curation, Introduction to Programming, Object Oriented Programming
