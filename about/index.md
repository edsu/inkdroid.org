ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Ed Summers and this is my weirdly named website. I'm a
[software developer] and [researcher] [working] at the intersection of
libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I'm interested in how the Web
functions as a sociotechnical system, especially with regard to memory
practices such as curation and preservation. I am currently working at Stanford
University Library on their Infrastructure Team.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on fediverse at [\@edsu@social.coop] and wandering Scuttlebutt as
`\@n2ax/dvrm+u76UhEv6aN0MzlH0Zw7o0MOd5QIHjouSw=.ed25519`. Once upon a time
I was on Twitter as [\@edsu] but I don't actively use it anymore--but you'll
see I have some bots that do.

#### Projects

This is a list of projects I'm working on at the moment. It's not meant to be a
fine grained list of tasks--I use other collaborative tools for that. It's
simply a place to write down the high level things that I'm working on, in an arbitrary order, so I can see them change over time.

* Webrecorder: WACZ Standardization
* social.coop: co-operatively run social media (Mastodon)
- maintaining / evolving digital repository infrastructure services
- institutional web archive services 
- slowly learning Rust
