Hi! My name is Ed Summers and this is my website. I'm a [software developer]
with two decades of [experience] working at the intersection of libraries,
archives and the World Wide Web. I study and work with the Web as a
sociotechnical system, with an eye to its evolving architecture and practices of
curation and preservation. I work at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in
the Humanities] and am a PhD Candidate in the College of Information Studies at
the University of Maryland.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on fediverse at [\@edsu@social.coop]. Once upon a time I was on Twitter
as [\@edsu] which I don't actively use anymore. Sometimes I still dabble in
Scuttlebutt as \@n2ax/dvrmlkjkjksjf:Sw=.ed25519 

#### Projects

This is a list of projects I'm working on at the moment. It's not meant to be a
fine grained list of tasks--I use other collaborative tools for that. It's
simply a place to write down the high level things that I'm actively engaged
with, in an arbitrary order, so I can see them change over time.

* Teaching Digital Curation: INST341 
* Documenting the Now Development
* Unlocking the Airwaves Development
* Lakeland Community Archive Development
