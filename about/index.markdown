Hi, my name is Ed Summers (on the right). I am a [recovering] software developer with two
decades of [experience] working at the intersection of libraries, archives and
the World Wide Web. I study and work with the Web as a sociotechnical system,
with a particular eye to its evolving architecture and practices of curation and
preservation. I also help to keep the lights on at the [Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities].
