<div style="font-size: 28pt;">
I am a [recovering] software developer with two decades of [experience] 
working at the intersection of libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I 
study and work with the Web as a sociotechnical system, with a particular eye to
its evolving architecture and practices of curation and preservation. I also
help to keep the lights on at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities].
