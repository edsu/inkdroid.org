    [&#8230;] year, I heard about a python program called Twarc, which was developed by Ed Summers, a software developer at the University of Maryland, to capture and archive tweets. Back in August, [&#8230;]

I've been working for a couple decades trying to bridge the worlds of libraries
and archives with the World Wide Web. This work has taken me into academia, startups, corporations and the government. I work best in agile, highly collaborative teams, that want to help make the world a better place, one website at a time.

I like to use this blog as a place to throw ideas around, to see what sticks.
They are my ideas alone and are not associated with my current employer. You can
find my code up on <a href="http://github.com/edsu">Github</a>, and my photos on
<a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/inkdroid">Flickr</a>. I like to chat
on <a href="http://twitter.com/edsu">Twitter</a>, and in the <a
href="irc://freenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a> IRC channel. I try to keep my
<a href="http://inkdroid.org/ehs/">CSV</a> fairly up to date. Feel free to get in touch with me via email at <a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">ehs@pobox.com</a>, you can find my public key <a href="https://keybase.io/edsu/key.asc">here</a>.

A bit more about me...

I've enjoyed using several computer programming languages over the years. I
guess it started with BASIC, Fortran and Pascal in the 1980s. I was very lucky
to have an excellent computer science teacher in High School. We had a lot of
fun. Thanks Mr Cave!

I started at university as an Engineering major, but after the first year I 
turned to Philosophy, then to Computer Science and finally landed 
in English Literature. On graduation I didn't end up doing much work with
computers. I spent three years working/traveling in the UK and then working in a used bookstore for two years in New Jersey. That's when the Web was just starting to really take shape, so I went back to University to get a Library and Information Science degree. The best bits were learning about hypermedia. Thanks Professor Burnett!

If you really want to know more I guess you can read about the rest in 
[my CV](/ehs/). The only important things that are missing from there
are Kesa and my three awesome kids. Kesa, if you are reading this -- thank you
for sharing your hope, pragmatism, joy and life with me.

Here are a few things I'm particularly fond of that I've worked on in the past:

* [anon] - a bot to tweet when someone edits wikipedia from a particular IP 
  address range, like [Congress]
* [wikistream] - a visualization of realtime edits to Wikipedia
* [pymarc] - process MARC data in Python
* [bagit] - a tool to package data using BagIt
* [chronam] - software that runs [Chronicling America] at the Library of 
  Congress
* [id] - the prototype that ran at [id.loc.gov] to make the Library of Congress
  Subject Headings available as Linked Data.

You can find the rest on [GitHub](http://github.com/edsu).
