## It's Our Web

I like [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/)'s [idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTaeVVAvk-c) that the web isn't just a place for big corporations. It's a place where we can try new things, and support others that are doing work that we like. With that in mind, these are people and projects I choose to financially support who work on the web:

* [Aquarium Drunkard](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/): A music journal with some good podcasts.
* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/edsu): I've supported lots of musicians over the past few years on Bandcamp. It's a great place to cultivate a network to learn about new music too.
* [Biblio](https://www.biblio.com/): it's a super place to find used books in bookstores around the world.
* [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/): a [b-corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)) where you can buy new books, which sends a little bit of love to your local booksellers.
* [Between the Covers](https://tinhouse.com/podcasts/): A literary podcast hosted by David Naimon from Tin House. His interviews are exceedingly well crafted, and with fascinating writers.
* [The Dig](https://thedigradio.com/): a political podcast hosted by Daniel Denvir for Jacobin Magazine. Long form interviews with political writers, thinkers and activists decidedly on the left.
* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkdroid): I've used Flickr for years as a place to publish my public and personal photographs.
* [JoggingHouse](https://jogginghouse.com/): A modular/ambient music artist I follow and chose to support.
* [Kagi](https://kagi.com): a web search application that I like better than Google and DuckDuckGo
* [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/): software I use to manage passwords
* [May First](https://mayfirst.org): A not-for-profit tech cooperative for left activists. My website runs on their servers.
* [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/): the text editor I use every day.
* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:edsu): I regularly bookmark things and put them here.
* [SocialCoop](https://wiki.social.coop): a co-operatively managed Mastodon instance
* [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/): a small company focused on making open source web archiving tools
