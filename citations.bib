    Abstract = "In this paper, we focus on one specific participatory installation developed for an exhibition in Aarhus (Denmark) by the Museum of Random Memory, a series of arts-based, public-facing workshops and interventions. The multichannel video installation experimented with how one memory (Trine's) can be represented in three very different ways, through algorithmic processes. We describe how this experiment troubles the everyday (mistaken) assumptions that digital archiving naturally includes the necessary codecs for future decoding of digital artifacts. We discuss what's at stake in critical (theory) discussions of data practices. Through this case, we offer an argument that from an ethical as well as epistemological perspective critical data studies can't be separated from an understanding of data as lived experience.",

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user's mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved---but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user's relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making.",

    Abstract = "Can events be accurately described as historic at the time they are happening? Claims of this sort are in effect predictions about the evaluations of future historians; that is, that they will regard the events in question as significant. Here we provide empirical evidence in support of earlier philosophical arguments1 that such claims are likely to be spurious and that, conversely, many events that will one day be viewed as historic attract little attention at the time. We introduce a conceptual and methodological framework for applying machine learning prediction models to large corpora of digitized historical archives. We find that although such models can correctly identify some historically important documents, they tend to overpredict historical significance while also failing to identify many documents that will later be deemed important, where both types of error increase monotonically with the number of documents under consideration. On balance, we conclude that historical significance is extremely difficult to predict, consistent with other recent work on intrinsic limits to predictability in complex social systems2,3. However, the results also indicate the feasibility of developing `artificial archivists'to identify potentially historic documents in very large digital corpora.",

    Abstract = "Significant parts of cultural heritage are produced on the web during the last decades. While easy accessibility to the current web is a good baseline, optimal access to the past web faces several challenges. This includes dealing with large-scale web archive collections and lacking of usage logs that contain implicit human feedback most relevant for today's web search. In this paper, we propose an entity-oriented search system to support retrieval and analytics on the Internet Archive. We use Bing to retrieve a ranked list of results from the current web. In addition, we link retrieved results to the WayBack Machine; thus allowing keyword search on the Internet Archive without processing and indexing its raw archived content. Our search system complements existing web archive search tools through a user-friendly interface, which comes close to the functionalities of modern web search engines (e.g., keyword search, query auto-completion and related query suggestion), and provides a great benefit of taking user feedback on the current web into account also for web archive search. Through extensive experiments, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses in order to provide insights that enable further research on and practical applications of web archives.",

The archival community, however, has largely neglected science data, assuming they were outside the bounds of their professional concerns. Scientists, on the other hand, increasingly recognize that they lack the skills and expertise needed to meet the demands being placed on them with regard to data curation and are seeking the help of ``data archivists'' and ``data curators.'' This represents a significant opportunity for archivists and archival scholars but one that can only be realized if they better understand the scientific context.",

Reviewing literature from the CSCW Journal and related conferences where CSCW work is published, we reflect on the contributions that have emerged from this work. The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking. We argue that this presents a number of challenges for CSCW research moving forward: in having a greater impact on larger-scale health IT projects; broadening the scope of settings and perspectives that are studied; and reflecting on the relevance of the traditional methods in this field - namely workplace studies - to meet these challenges.",

In these time sensitive situations it is difficult for archivists to build a list of potential seed URLs to harvest, because of the large amount of new content being published on the Web in a very short time period. The goal was to prototype and test a system that could run with minimum human intervention. This was the first reference I could find of using Twitter in this way to augment web archiving, which was discussed more fully in Gossen et al. (2015).",

    Annote = "Appraisal is often thought about in terms of what artifacts to preserve or save for the future. But implicit in every decision to save is also a decision not to forget. Consequently, it's also possible to look at appraisal as decisions about about what can be forgotten. In this paper Kanhabua and her colleagues at the L3S Research Center investigate processes for making these types of decisions which they call *managed forgetting* which is materialized in the form of *forgetting actions* such as aggregation, summarization, revised search, ranking behavior, elimination of redundancy and deletion. The article provides a useful entrance point into the literature about human memory in the field of cognitive psychology. It also highlights several jumping off points for HCI discussions about designing systems and devices for managing memory. But the primary focus of the paper is on the interaction between information management systems and archival information systems: the first which is used to access information, and the second being the stores of content that can be accessed. In order to describe how the act of forgetting is evidenced in these systems they used historical snapshots of public bookmarks available in the [BibSonomy] social bookmarking tool. The 15 BibSonomy snapshots taken at different periods of time provide a view into when users have chosen to bookmark a particular resource, as well as when that resource has been deleted. Their analysis determined that there was a correlation between a users delete ratio and the number of bookmarks they created, but not between the users delete ratio and the total number of bookmarks they possessed. The paper admits that they are still in a very early phase of research into the idea of *managed forgetting*. I think the paper does a nice job of articulating why this way of looking at appraisal systems matters, and providing an example of one possible study that could be done in this area. I think it would have been useful to discuss a little bit more about how the choice of BibSonomy as a platform to study could potentially influence (but not invalidate) the results. It would be interesting to take another social bookmarking site like Pinboard or Digg and see if a similar correlation holds. The implications of managed forgetting for building digital preservation and access systems seems like a very viable area of research, and I hope to see more from them.",

governance of development projects. The introduction of big data has
altered the field of visibility. Employing Dean's “analytics of
government” framework, we analyze two cases—malaria tracking in Kenya
and monitoring of food prices in Indonesia. Our analysis shows that big
data introduces a bias toward particular types of visualizations. What
problems are being made visible through big data depends to some degree
on how the underlying data is visualized and who is captured in the
visualizations. It is also influenced by technical factors such as
distance between mobile phone towers and the truth claims that gain
legitimacy. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

confront their complicity in a documentary landscape that excludes and

Archival professional organisations in both countries attempt to
confront this issue by focusing on the homogeneity of the profession,
specifically through using the discourse of diversity. Thus, this
keynote address, delivered at the 2017 conference of the Australian
Society of Archivists in Melbourne, explores the following question:
how, if at all, does diversity form part of the solution for dismantling
the white supremacy of archives? It begins this inquiry by recounting
the author's participation and experience with diversity projects of the
Society of American Archivists, before speculating how archivists might
transition away from the language of diversity and towards the language
of liberation through the concept of an archive of the oppressed. The
central argument of the addre},

produces and uses to this aim, how it measures states' performance in
this field are all relevant issues mirroring the idea of (digital)
Europe that the EU intends to build. Drawing on previous studies that
have emphasised the political aspects of measurement and the
governmentality power of indicators, the authors maintain that the way
the EU measures the implementation of digital policies reflects a
neoliberal vision of what a digital Europe should look like;
furthermore, through rankings and ratings, the EU exerts a
governmentality power on member states by conducting their behaviour at
a distance. After introducing the theme, the study deepens the political
dimension of evaluation and unfolds its crucial connection with
neoliberalisation. Then it focuses on the European case, wi},

mundane but mission-critical tasks. Algorithms seldom operate on their
own and their (dis)utilities are dependent on the everyday aspects of
data capture, processing and utilization. However, as algorithms become
increasingly autonomous and invisible, they become harder for the public
to detect and scrutinize their impartiality status . Algorithms can
systematically introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical
discrimination, favor a political orientation or reinforce undesired
practices. Yet it is difficult to hold algorithms accountable as they
continuously evolve with technologies, systems, data and people, the ebb
and flow of policy priorities, and the clashes between new and old
institutional logics. Greater openness and transparency do not
necessarily improve understanding. In this editorial we argue that

It examines the spread of this perspective, focusing in particular on how this genealogical approach to the analysis of the conduct of each and of all has been taken up and developed in the English-speaking world. It evaluates some of the key criticisms that have been made of the analytics of governmentality and argues for the continuing productivity and creativity of these ways of analyzing the emergence, nature, and consequences of the arts of government. },
