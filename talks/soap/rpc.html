Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply have clients call the functions on the
server without having to negotiate the connection and a protocol for the
transaction? Fortunately other people have already thought about this and
created the <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=rpc">
RPC (Remote Procedure Call)</a>.
</p>

<p>Sun developed the RPC specification in 1988, but since it wasn't as platform
independent as some people wanted the Object Management Group (a consortium 
of 700 companies which include IBM, Apple and Sun) released the <a
href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=corba&action=Search">
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)</a> in 1990. Microsoft 
developed it's own slightly less capable version of CORBA in 1996 known as
DCOM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/02/xml-at-5.html">XML</a> came on the scene 
in 1998 and prompted some to think about simplifying CORBA by re-expressing the
idea of RPC as XML over HTTP. A group was formed (now the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/">W3C XML Protocol Working Group</a>).
Dave Winer had some experience with RPC over XML, and was part of this initial
working group. After some <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$555">frustration</a> with the 
consensus making Dave Winer released an early draft of the work as 
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XMLRPC</a>. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">SOAP v1.1</a> was finally released in 2000.
