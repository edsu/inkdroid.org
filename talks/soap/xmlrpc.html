<p>XMLRPC and SOAP both allow you to perform remote procedure calls as XML
messages sent as part of a regular HTTP POST. So as far as HTTP is concerned
XMLRPC and SOAP are just HTTP POST requests which happen to have XML data
in them rather than the results of a HTML form.</p>

<p>As you might expect from the history of the two standards, XMLRPC is a 
great deal simpler than SOAP. Unlike XMLRPC SOAP allows you to use other 
transport mechanisms than HTTP (SMTP, FTP, Jabber). SOAP also is not tied
directly to the client/server model, so messages can be passed in other 
configurations such as a peer-to-peer network. To achieve these ends SOAP
uses more advanced features of XML than XMLRPC (namespaces, schemas).</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that SOAP can be just as simple as 
XMLRPC, but it can also be more complicated if you need it to be. Kind of 
like the Perl motto "to make easy things easy, and hard things possible".
