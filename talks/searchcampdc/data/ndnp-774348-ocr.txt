Mrs.   Pptter   Palmer,   has   declined   with   thanks   an
appointment   to   act   as   a   volunteer   garbage   inspector
in   her   ward   in   Chicago   •,   on   the   ground   that   she   has
arranged   for   certain,social   functions.for   the   summer
at   .Newport;,   and   so   Chicago   loses   the   joy   of   having
a   society'leader   for   a   garbage   woman,   while   Newport
has   the   satisfaction   of   having   a   garbage   inspector   for
a   social   leader.

THE   Seattle   Times*finds   itself   enraged   by   The
Call's   use   of   the   term   "Altbryangeldism"   to   de -
scribe   that   queer   political   mixture   which   has
been   on   tap   in   this   country   since   1896.   Our   critic   de -
clares   that   it   is   unAmerican   to   indulge   in   such   criti -
cism   of   the   minority   party,   and   asks   if   it   is   wise   or
prudent   to   do   so   "in   a   republic   like   ours,   where   the
safety   of   the   nation   and   the   liberties   of   the^pebple
depend   upon   a   very   equal   division   of   the   people   into
political   parties."
The   republic   and   the   liberties   of   the   people   seem
to   have   stood   that   sort   of   thing   very   well   so   far,   and
we   are   unable   to   comprehend   how   they   are   endan -
gered   by   criticizing   a   minority   and   not   by   serving   a
majority   party   the   scmc^way.   'The   Times   seasons,
adorns   and   illustrates   its   lecture   on   propriety   by   call -
ing   Republicanism   "Hannaism"   and   declaring   that   "it
has   uniformly   stood   for   oppression,   while   Bryanism
and*   Altgeldism   have   always   stood   for   greater   liberty
and   greater   benefits   to   the   common   people,   and   as
between   the   two   every   honest   man   will   choose   Bryan -
ism.   even   with   all   the   sneers   and   leers   which   such
publications   as   The   Call   may   choose   to   make."
Now   that   is   good.   Twice   the   whole   people   have
had   the   chance   to   choose   between   the   two,   and   ac -
cording   to   this   Seattle   oracle   all   the   honest   ones   have
chosen   Bryanism.   Then   a   vast   majority   of   our   people
are   not   honest.   .
The   Times   should   go   and   study   logic   for   a   few
years,   and   then   take   such   a   turn   in   physics   as   to   learn
not   to   sit   on   a   limb   and   saw   the   same   off   between
itself   and   the   tree.   \
We   believe   in   freedom   of   criticism   and   that   the
same   rule   applies   to   minority   and   majority   parties   and
is   equally   American.   The   people   are   the   final   judges;
They   sift   the   wheaffrom   the   chaff,   the   true   from   the
false,   as   they   did   in   1896   and   •   1000.   We   deny   the
Times'   position   that   only   dishonest   men   voted   against
Bryan.   To   admit   is   to   disclose   the.   most   horrible
situation   that   can   be   conceived   for   a   republic.   We
do   not   deny   that    our   countrymen,   that
they   were   wrong.   .;
No   doubt   Mr.   Bryan   is   a.   model   of   .the   domestic
and   civic   virtues,   but   he   can   be   that   and   at   the   same
time   be   the   most   fantastic   freak   that   has   ever   cavorted
and   kicked   high   in   American   politics.   His   principles
_re   certainly   not   Democratic,   when   measured   by   the
teachings   of   Jefferson   or   passed   upo   one   but   Mr.   Bryan
is   to   blame.'   He   has   alienated   the   common   s^nse   of
the   country   from   fhe   party   he   has   created   and   led,

f->   UCH   State   elections   as   will   be   held   this   fall   will
not   be   of   much   interest   to   the   nation   as   a
S^   whole,   but   in   the.   commonwealths   where'they
are   to   occur   the   political   pot   is   already   beginning   to
boil,   and   in   two   of   them,   Virginia   and   Ohio,   it   is
probable   the   contests   will   be   quite   vigorous.
It   has'been   hitherto   deemed   fairly   certain   that   in
Ohio   the   Republicans   would   renominate   Governor
Nash,   but   recently   there   have   appeared   evidences   of
a   considerable   opposition   to   him.   It   is   quite   likely
of   course   that   when   the   convention   meets   the   oppo -
sition   will   prove   to   have   been   more   noisy   than   strong,
but   none-the   less-it   i*   making   a   pretense   at   least   of
getting   up   an.   earnest   fight   against   him.   In   one   re -
spect   the   Governor   is   fortunate   in   having   such   an
opposition,   for   according   to   the   reports   that   come   to
us   the   main   argument   used   against   him   is   that   he
has   made   himself   unpopular   by   stopping   the   Cin -
cinnati   prize-fight.   It   is   safe   to   say   that"any   voteshe   may
lose   among   the   sporting   Element   on   that   ac -
count   will   be   more   than   compensated   by   those   of
good   citizens   who   respect   him   for   the   awill   <   be   ¦.ordered
'   in1
proportion.;   It   will   be   seen.that   the   prosperity   of   the
.country   ;is">making   the   railroad,   men'   work   hard   to
keep   up^with   the-procession.   What   would'"   be   ;   the
condition\of'the'country.if   at   this   time   our   railroads
were   under   Government   control   and   we   had*   to   wait
for^Congress   to   meet   and   make   an   appropriation   be -
fore   'orders   could   be   given   for   new   cars!   and   new
'locomotives?./   >   .   .•   .   r   f   ¦   .
A   recent-dispatch   from   Philadelphia   said:   ".With
orders   enough   ahead   to   '   keep   five   hundred   hands
busily   erilployedlof   months,   the   blanket   mills   of   Wil -
liam   &   James   Stafford   in   Manayunk   have   shut   down,
to   remain   closed   for   two   weeks.   This   unusual   con -
dition   is   due   to   the   fact,   it   is   stated,   that   all   the
stor -
age   room'the   company   has   at   its   command   is   choked
with   manufactured   goods,:andiit   is   unable   to,   ;get
transportation   facilities   to   carry   the   products   away.
Haifa   thousand   wage-earners   "are   thus   thrown   out   of
work   when,   under   ordinary   conditions,   they   might
be   actively   arid   uninterruptedly   engaged.   Both.the
Pennsylvania   and   Reading   railroads   are   accessible
to   the   Stafford   mills,   and   both   corporations   have
been   appealed   to,   but   owing   to.   the   generally   prosper -
ous   .state   of   business   in*   the   Manayunk   manufactories
the   roads   are   having   the   greatest   difficulty   intrying   to
tak"e   care   of   the   business   offered   theni."
While   the   validi of   the   argument   -may   be   •   dis -
puted,   it   is   undeniable   "that-at*   present   the   tremen -
dous   expansion   of-Arherican   energy   in   traffic   and
travel   has   surpassed   the   preparations   made   for
handling   it   by,   evert   the   most   enterprising   roads.   It
will   be   remembered   that   .'some..difficulty   was   expe -
rienced   in   this   State   in   obtaining   cars   to   handle   the
citrus   fruit   <*rop,   and   the   situation   seems   to   be   far
worse   in   the   East.
RECENTLY   in.   a   discussion   of   the   question./of
rates   of   fare   offered   by   railway   companies   to
the   Pan-American   Exposition   some   authorities
on   railroad   matters   argued,that   if   rates,   were;fixed;at
what-^are   known   as   popular^prices   the^movement   of
passenger   travel   would   be   larger   than   the   roads.can'
handle.   One   of   them   said   railroad   officials   "should
remember   that   all'   who?;travel   are-   ri  attracted   -by
cheap   excursions,   and   that   those   who   do   not   want   to
go   to   the   fair   have.a   right   to.   demand   that   their   regu -
