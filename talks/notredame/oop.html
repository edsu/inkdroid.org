<p>You are probably already familiar with variable types, and functions.
OOP adds a few more pieces of terminology: the class, method and field.</p>

<p>Object oriented programming languages aid the programmer while creating and
maintaining applications in several ways:

<ul>
<li>OOP allows you to think about your application in terms of component pieces.
It is a useful exercise to think about what components your application is made
up of, how they relate and what they have in common.</li>
<li>OOP promotes code reuse.</li>
<li>OOP hides implementation behind method calls. This hiding encourages
a decoupling of program components and makes it easier to make changes to your
programs without having unexpected results.</li>
<li>OOP programs are easier to test since the components can be instantiated
and tested without dependencies on other code.</li>
</ul>
